	abstract = {The first Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) was launched in October 2011 aboard the Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite. The VIIRS instrument carries two separate sets of multi-spectral channels providing full global coverage at both 375m and 750m nominal resolutions every 12h or less depending on the latitude. In this study, we introduce a new VIIRS active fire detection algorithm, which is driven primarily by the 375m middle and thermal infrared imagery data. The algorithm builds on the well-established MODIS Fire and Thermal Anomalies product using a contextual approach to detect both day and nighttime biomass burning and other thermal anomalies. Here we present the fire algorithm's design and implementation, including important information describing the input data characteristics and potential artifacts associated with pixel saturation and the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly, both found to affect the middle infrared channel data. Initial assessment using results derived from the global processing of the algorithm indicated small, although variable, commission errors ({\textless}1.2\%) for nominal confidence fire pixels. We achieved improved performance using the 375m active fire data compared to the VIIRS 750m baseline fire product, resulting in a 3× and 25× factor increase in the absolute number of fire pixels detected using day and nighttime data, respectively. Similarly, VIIRS 375m fire data showed significantly superior mapping capabilities compared to current MODIS fire detection data with improved consistency of fire perimeter delineation for biomass burning lasting multiple days.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2311.11777},
	abstract = {The integration of multisource remote sensing data and deep learning models offers new possibilities for accurately mapping high spatial resolution forest height. We found that GEDI relative heights (RH) metrics exhibited strong correlation with the mean of the top 10 highest trees (dominant height) measured in situ at the corresponding footprint locations. Consequently, we proposed a novel deep learning framework termed the multi-modal attention remote sensing network (MARSNet) to estimate forest dominant height by extrapolating dominant height derived from GEDI, using Setinel-1 data, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, Sentinel-2 optical data and ancillary data. MARSNet comprises separate encoders for each remote sensing data modality to extract multi-scale features, and a shared decoder to fuse the features and estimate height. Using individual encoders for each remote sensing imagery avoids interference across modalities and extracts distinct representations. To focus on the efficacious information from each dataset, we reduced the prevalent spatial and band redundancies in each remote sensing data by incorporating the extended spatial and band reconstruction convolution modules in the encoders. MARSNet achieved commendable performance in estimating dominant height, with an R2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 2.82 m, outperforming the widely used random forest approach which attained an R2 of 0.55 and RMSE of 3.05 m. Finally, we applied the trained MARSNet model to generate wall-to-wall maps at 10 m resolution for Jilin, China. Through independent validation using field measurements, MARSNet demonstrated an R2 of 0.58 and RMSE of 3.76 m, compared to 0.41 and 4.37 m for the random forest baseline. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of a multimodal deep learning approach fusing GEDI with SAR and passive optical imagery for enhancing the accuracy of high resolution dominant height estimation.},

	abstract = {The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) instrument, as all FW systems, relies on very sophisticated pre-processing steps to generate a priori metrics in order to accurately estimate forest characteristics, such as forest heights and wood volume. The ever-expanding volume of acquired GEDI data, which to September 2020 comprised more than 25 billion shots, and requiring more than 90 TB of storage space, raises new challenges in terms of adapted preprocessing methods for the suitable exploitation of such a huge and complex amount of LiDAR data. Therefore, to avoid metric computation, we leveraged deep learning techniques in order to estimate canopy dominant heights (Hdom) and wood volume (V) of Eucalyptus plantations over five different regions in Brazil. Performance comparisons were conducted between a convolutional neural network based model that uses GEDI waveform data and a previously used, metric based, Random Forest regressor (RF). Cross-validated results showed that the CNN based model compared well against the RF counterpart for both Hdom and V. Indeed, the RMSE on the estimation of Hdom from the CNN based model was 1.61 m with a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.90, while the RF model produced an accuracy on Hdom estimates of 1.45 m(R2=0.92). For V, CNN based estimates was 27.35 m3.ha-1(R2 of 0.88), while for RF, the RMSE was 27.60 m3.ha-1 (R2=0.88).},

	abstract = {Nowadays Earth observation satellites provide forest fire authorities and resource managers with spatial and comprehensive information for fire stabilization and recovery. Burn severity mapping is typically performed by classifying bi-temporal indices (e.g., dNBR, and RdNBR) using thresholds derived from parametric models incorporating field-based measurements. Analysts are currently expending considerable manual effort using prior knowledge and visual inspection to determine burn severity thresholds. In this study, we aim to employ highly automated approaches to provide spatially explicit damage level estimates. We first reorganize a large-scale Landsat-based bi-temporal burn severity assessment dataset (Landsat-BSA) by visual data cleaning based on annotated MTBS data (approximately 1000 major fire events in the United States). Then we apply state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) based methods to map burn severity based on the Landsat-BSA dataset. Experimental results emphasize that multi-class semantic segmentation algorithms can approximate the threshold-based techniques used extensively for burn severity classification. UNet-like models outperform other region-based CNN and Transformer-based models and achieve accurate pixel-wise classification results. Combined with the online hard example mining algorithm to reduce class imbalance issue, Attention UNet achieves the highest mIoU (0.78) and the highest Kappa coefficient close to 0.90. The bi-temporal inputs with ancillary spectral indices work much better than the uni-temporal multispectral inputs. The restructured dataset will be publicly available and create opportunities for further advances in remote sensing and wildfire communities.},

	abstract = {Geographic information is essential for modeling tasks in fields ranging from ecology to epidemiology. However, extracting relevant location characteristics for a given task can be challenging, often requiring expensive data fusion or distillation from massive global imagery datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce Satellite Contrastive Location-Image Pretraining (SatCLIP). This global, general-purpose geographic location encoder learns an implicit representation of locations by matching CNN and ViT inferred visual patterns of openly available satellite imagery with their geographic coordinates. The resulting SatCLIP location encoder efficiently summarizes the characteristics of any given location for convenient use in downstream tasks. In our experiments, we use SatCLIP embeddings to improve prediction performance on nine diverse location-dependent tasks including temperature prediction, animal recognition, and population density estimation. Across tasks, SatCLIP consistently outperforms alternative location encoders and improves geographic generalization by encoding visual similarities of spatially distant environments. These results demonstrate the potential of vision-location models to learn meaningful representations of our planet from the vast, varied, and largely untapped modalities of geospatial data.},

	abstract = {Learning representations of geographical space is vital for any machine learning model that integrates geolocated data, spanning application domains such as remote sensing, ecology, or epidemiology. Recent work embeds coordinates using sine and cosine projections based on Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) features. These embeddings assume a rectangular data domain even on global data, which can lead to artifacts, especially at the poles. At the same time, little attention has been paid to the exact design of the neural network architectures with which these functional embeddings are combined. This work proposes a novel location encoder for globally distributed geographic data that combines spherical harmonic basis functions, natively defined on spherical surfaces, with sinusoidal representation networks (SirenNets) that can be interpreted as learned Double Fourier Sphere embedding. We systematically evaluate positional embeddings and neural network architectures across various benchmarks and synthetic evaluation datasets. In contrast to previous approaches that require the combination of both positional encoding and neural networks to learn meaningful representations, we show that both spherical harmonics and sinusoidal representation networks are competitive on their own but set state-of-the-art performances across tasks when combined.

	abstract = {Forests are continuously altered by disturbances. Yet, knowledge of global pattern of forest disturbance agents, its drivers, and shifts under changing climate remain scarce. Here we present a meta-analysis of current and projected (+2° and + 4 °C) distribution of forest disturbance agents causing immediate tree mortality (i.e., fire, pest outbreak, hydro-geomorphic, and wind) at country, continental, biome, and global scales. The model including combination of climatic (precipitation of driest quarter, actual evapotranspiration, and minimum temperature), geographical (distance to coast and topography complexity), and forest characteristics (tree density) performs better than any other model in explaining the distribution of disturbance agents (R2 = 0.74). We provide global maps (0.5° × 0.5°) of current and potential future distribution of forest disturbance agents. Globally, the most frequent disturbance agent was fire (46.09 \%), followed by pest outbreak (23.27 \%), hydro-geomorphic disturbances (18.97 \%), and wind (11.67 \%). Our projections indicate spatially contrasting shifts in disturbance agents, with fire and wind risk increase between {\textasciitilde}50°S and {\textasciitilde} 40°N under warming climate. In particular, the substantial increase in fire risk, exceeding 31 \% in the most affected areas, is projected over Mediterranean, the western and southeast USA, African, Oceanian, and South American forests. On the other hand, pest outbreak and hydro-geomorphic disturbances are projected to increase in more southern ({\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 50°S) and northern ({\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 40°N) latitudes. Our findings are critical for understanding ongoing changes and developing mitigation strategies to maintain the ecological integrity and ecosystem services under shifts in forest disturbances. We suggest that projected shifts in the global distribution of forest disturbance agents needs to be considered to future models of vegetation or carbon sink dynamics under projected climate change.},

	abstract = {With the advent of the next generation of space-based laser altimeters, ICESat-2 and GEDI, we are entering an exciting era of active remote sensing of forests that offers unprecedented opportunities for the observation of forest structure. Consistent comparisons of the accuracy of terrain and canopy height retrievals for these two missions are essential for continued improvement and further application. Because the time interval between the spaceborne products and validation data may introduce additional errors, we validate the newly released GEDI L2A product (version 2) and the ICESat-2 ATL08 product (version 4) using high-resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar products acquired in the same year (2019) as the reference datasets. In addition, our study area contains 40 sites located in the U.S. mainland, Alaska, and Hawaii that encompass a variety of eco-climatic zones and vegetation cover types; thus, it avoids the uncertainties associated with small sample sizes and restricted spatial coverage. The results show that ICESat-2 and GEDI yield reasonable estimates of terrain height, with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 2.24 and 4.03 m for mid and low latitudes, respectively, and 0.98 m for high latitudes (ICESat-2 only). ICESat-2 outperforms GEDI across the board for terrain height retrieval, although they both have better accuracy than existing SRTM and GMTED DEM products. Analyses of the error factors suggest that steep slopes ({\textgreater}30◦) present the greatest challenge for both GEDI and ICESat-2; in addition, tall ({\textgreater}20 m) and dense canopies ({\textgreater}90\%) forest ecosystems also reduce the accuracy of the terrain height estimates. When ICESat2 and GEDI data are used for canopy height retrieval, the use of only strong/power beam data acquired at night is recommended, as the overall RMSEs decrease from 7.21 and 5.02 m to 3.93 and 3.56 m, respectively, compared to using all data regardless of daytime and beam strength. GEDI outperforms ICESat-2 across the board for canopy height retrieval, as ICESat-2 has a larger potential bias for almost all forest types and cover conditions. ICESat-2 tends to overestimate the canopy height of dwarf shrublands and underestimate the canopy height of forest, and there is a gradual downward shift in the distribution of residuals with increasing canopy height. Overall, ICESat-2 with photon counting technology and GEDI with full waveform technology each represent the state of the art in spaceborne laser altimeters for terrain and canopy height retrieval. Combined, these two missions can take advantage of the unique strengths of each instrument.},

The GEDI vegetation height error is 5 m at the tropical sites, similar to the expected performance of the future spaceborne BIOMASS mission.

	abstract = {The increase in Earth observations from space in recent years supports improved quantification of carbon storage by terrestrial vegetation and fosters studies that relate satellite measurements to biomass retrieval algorithms. However, satellite observations are only indirectly related to the carbon stored by vegetation. While ground surveys provide biomass stock measurements to act as reference for training the models, they are sparsely distributed. Here, we addressed this problem by designing an algorithm that harnesses the interplay of satellite observations, modeling frameworks and field measurements, and generated global estimates of above-ground biomass (AGB) density that meet the requirements of the scientific community in terms of accuracy, spatial and temporal resolution. The design was adapted to the amount, type and spatial distribution of satellite data available around the year 2020. The retrieval algorithm estimated AGB annually by merging estimates derived from C- and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter observations with a Water Cloud type of model and does not rely on AGB reference data at the same spatial scale as the SAR data. This model is integrated with functions relating to forest structural variables that were trained on spaceborne LiDAR observations and subnational AGB statistics. The yearly estimates of AGB were successively harmonized using a cost function that minimizes spurious fluctuations arising from the moderate-to-weak sensitivity of the SAR backscatter to AGB. The spatial distribution of the AGB estimates was correctly reproduced when the retrieval model was correctly set. Over-predictions occasionally occurred in the low AGB range ({\textless}50 Mg ha 1) and under-predictions in the high AGB range ({\textgreater}300 Mg ha 1). These errors were a consequence of sometimes too strong generalizations made within the modeling framework to allow reliable retrieval worldwide at the expense of accuracy. The precision of the estimates was mostly between 30\% and 80\% relative to the estimated value. While the framework is well founded, it could be improved by incorporating additional satellite observations that capture structural properties of vegetation (e.g., from SAR interferometry, low-frequency SAR, or high-resolution observations), a dense network of regularly monitored high-quality forest biomass reference sites, and spatially more detailed characterization of all model parameters estimates to better reflect regional differences.},

	abstract = {Earth Observation data are uniquely positioned to estimate forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD) in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) principles of ‘transparency, accuracy, completeness, consistency and comparability’. However, the use of space-based AGBD maps for national-level reporting to the UNFCCC is nearly non-existent as of 2023, the end of the first global stocktake (GST). We conduct an evidence-based comparison of AGBD estimates from the NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation and ESA Climate Change Initiative, describing differences between the products and National Forest Inventories (NFIs), and suggesting how science teams must align efforts to inform the next GST. Between the products, in the tropics, the largest differences in estimated AGBD are primarily in the Congolese lowlands and east/southeast Asia. Where NFI data were acquired (Peru, Mexico, Lao PDR and 30 regions of Spain), both products show strong correlation to NFI-estimated AGBD, with no systematic deviations. The AGBD-richest stratum of these, the Peruvian Amazon, is accurately estimated in both. These results are remarkably promising, and to support the operational use of AGB map products for policy reporting, we describe targeted ways to align products with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. We recommend moving towards consistent statistical terminology, and aligning on a rigorous framework for uncertainty estimation, supported by the provision of open-science codes for large-area assessments that comprehensively report uncertainty. Further, we suggest the provision of objective and open-source guidance to integrate NFIs with multiple AGBD products, aiming to enhance the precision of national estimates. Finally, we describe and encourage the release of user-friendly product documentation, with tools that produce AGBD estimates directly applicable to the IPCC guideline methodologies. With these steps, space agencies can convey a comparable, reliable and consistent message on global biomass estimates to have actionable policy impact.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Large-scale fire emission estimates may be influenced by the spatial resolution of the model and input datasets used. Especially in areas with relatively heterogeneous land cover, a coarse model resolution might lead to substantial errors in estimates. We developed a model using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations of burned area and vegetation characteristics to study the impact of spatial resolution on modelled fire emission estimates. We estimated fire emissions for sub-Saharan Africa at 500 m spatial resolution (native MODIS burned area) for the 2002–2017 period, using a simplified version of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) modelling framework, and compared this to model runs at a range of coarser resolutions (0.050, 0.125, 0.250∘). We estimated fire emissions of 0.68 Pg C yr−1 at 500 m resolution and 0.82 Pg C yr−1 at 0.25∘ resolution; a difference of 24 \%. At 0.25∘ resolution, our model results were relatively similar to GFED4, which also runs at 0.25∘ resolution, whereas our 500 m estimates were substantially lower. We found that lower emissions at finer resolutions are mainly the result of reduced representation errors when comparing modelled estimates of fuel load and consumption to field measurements, as part of the model calibration. Additional errors stem from the model simulation at coarse resolution and lead to an additional 0.02 Pg C yr−1 difference in estimates. These errors exist due to the aggregation of quantitative and qualitative model input data; the average- or majority- aggregated values are propagated in the coarse-resolution simulation and affect the model parameterization and the final result. We identified at least three error mechanisms responsible for the differences in estimates between 500 m and 0.25∘ resolution simulations, besides those stemming from representation errors in the calibration process, namely (1) biome misclassification leading to errors in parameterization, (2) errors due to the averaging of input data and the associated reduction in variability, and (3) a temporal mechanism related to the aggregation of burned area in particular. Even though these mechanisms largely neutralized each other and only modestly affect estimates at a continental scale, they lead to substantial error at regional scales with deviations of up to a factor 4 and may affect large-scale estimates differently for other continents. These findings could prove valuable in improving coarse-resolution models and suggest the need for increased spatial resolution in global fire emission models.},

Across the southern Amazon, 19,700 deforestation fire events accounted for 39\% of all satellite active fire detections and the majority of fire carbon emissions (63\%; 69 Tg C). Multiday fires accounted for 81\% of burned area and 92\% of carbon emissions from the Amazon, with many forest fires burning uncontrolled for weeks. Most fire detections from deforestation fires were correctly identified within 2 days (67\%), highlighting the potential to improve situational awareness and management outcomes during fire emergencies.},

	abstract = {Long-term records of burned area are needed to understand wildfire dynamics, assess fire impacts on ecosystems and air quality, and improve fire forecasts. Here, we fuse multiple streams of remote sensing data to create a 24 year (1997–2020) dataset of monthly burned area as a component of the fifth version of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED5). During 2001–2020, we use the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD64A1 burned area product and adjust for the errors of commission and omission. Adjustment factors are estimated based on region, land cover, and tree cover fraction, using spatiotemporally aligned burned area from Landsat or Sentinel-2. Burned area in croplands, peatlands, and deforestation regions is estimated from MODIS active fire detections. Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) and Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) active fire data are used to extend the time series back to 1997. The global annual burned area during 2001–2020 is estimated to be 774 ± 63 Mha yr−1 or 5.9 ± 0.5 \% of ice-free land. Burned area declined by 1.21 ± 0.66 \% yr−1, a cumulative decrease of 24.2 ± 13.2 \% over 20 years. The global reduction is primarily driven by a decrease in fires in savannas, grasslands, and croplands. Forest, peat, and deforestation fires did not exhibit significant long-term trends. The GFED5 global burned area is 93 \% higher than MCD64A1, 61 \% higher than GFED4s, and in closer agreement with products from higher-resolution satellite sensors. These data may reduce discrepancies between fire emission estimates from activity-based and atmospheric-based approaches, and improve our understanding of global fire impacts on the carbon cycle and climate system.

This paper aims to illustrate an integrated modelling approach combining spatial and non-spatial inputs to provide and enhance the estimation of GHG and particulate matter emissions from surface fires using Italy as a case study over the period 2007–2017. Three main improvements characterize the approach proposed in this work: (i) the collection and development of comprehensive and accurate data inputs related to burned area; (ii) the use of the most recent data on fuel type and load; and (iii) the modelling application to estimate fuel moisture, burning efficiency, and fuel consumption considering meteorological factors and combustion phases. On average, Italy's GHG and particulate matter emissions were 2621 Gg yr−1, ranging from a minimum of 772 Gg yr−1 in 2013 to a maximum of 7020 Gg yr−1 in 2007. Emissions from fire disturbances in broadleaf forests, shrublands, and agricultural fuel types account for about 76 \% of the total. Results were compared with global and national inventories and showed good agreement, especially considering CO2 and particulate matter. The approach of this study added confidence in emission estimates, and the results can be utilized in decision support systems to address air quality management and fire impact mitigation policies.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing techniques are effectively used for measuring the overall loss of terrestrial ecosystem productivity and biodiversity due to forest fires. The current research focuses on assessing the impacts of forest fires on terrestrial ecosystem productivity in India during 2003–2017. Spatiotemporal changes of satellite remote sensing derived burn indices were estimated for both fire and normal years to analyze the association between forest fires and ecosystem productivity. Two Light Use Efficiency (LUE) models were used to quantify the terrestrial Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of the forest ecosystem using the open-source and freely available remotely sensed data. A novel approach (delta NPP/delta burn indices) is developed to quantify the effects of forest fires on terrestrial carbon emission and ecosystem production. During 2003–2017, the forest fire intensity was found to be very high ({\textgreater}2000) across the eastern Himalayan hilly region, which is mostly covered by dense forest and thereby highly susceptible to wildfires. Scattered patches of intense forest fires were also detected in the lower Himalayan and central Indian states. The spatial correlation between the burn indices and NPP were mainly negative (−0.01 to −0.89) for the fire-prone states as compared to the other neighbouring regions. Additionally, the linear approximation between the burn indices and NPP showed a positive relation (0.01 to 0.63), suggesting a moderate to high impact of the forest fires on the ecosystem production and terrestrial carbon emission. The present approach has the potential to quantify the loss of ecosystem productivity due to forest fires.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic carbon emissions directly contribute to global warming, which has induced severe environmental concerns like extreme droughts and devastating fires. To evaluate the effects of fires on carbon cycling and climate change, it is crucial to accurately estimate the amount of carbon released during fires. The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission offers spaceborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements of global forests, providing excellent opportunities for monitoring forest dynamics and carbon emissions. The ICESat-2 Land and vegetation height product (ATL08), Landsat 8 data, and Sentinel-1 data were integrated to estimate biomass burning emissions with a three-phase hierarchy model. In Phase 1, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to establish the relationship between ATL08 LiDAR metrics and reference aboveground biomass (AGB), R2 0.77 and RMSE 56.67 Mg ha−1. In Phase 2, the LASSO regression predicted AGB for all ATL08 segments. A Random Forest Regression model was trained with Landsat 8 reflectance data and derived vegetation indices, Sentinel-1 data, and terrain variables as predictors and with the LASSO predicted AGB as the response variable, R2 0.71 and RMSE 45.91 Mg ha−1. Wall-to-wall maps of pre-fire and post-fire AGB were produced with the Random Forest model. In Phase 3, the difference between the pre-fire and the post-fire AGB was converted to carbon emissions. The estimated biomass burning emissions of the 2018 Carr fire group, the 2018 Camp fire, and the 2019 Walker fire in California are 3.54 (± 0.067) Tg C, 1.66 (± 0.041) Tg C, and 0.45 (± 0.022) Tg C, respectively. Forests have the highest biomass burning emissions with an average emission of 30.09 Mg ha−1, approximately twice and four times the average emissions from shrubs and grasses. This study highlights the merit of integrating spaceborne remote sensing data, including LiDAR data, optical data, and radar data, for estimating biomass burning emissions, opening an avenue for accurate forest biomass and carbon dynamics monitoring, as well as climate change mitigation.},

	abstract = {Wildfires have been progressively shrinking the C sink capacity of forest accelerating climate change effects on forest biodiversity, especially where megafires are recurrent and of increased frequency such as in the Mediterranean. Data from The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission can inform on changes on forest structure to inform on fire impacts on vegetation. In this study, we assessed the performance of GEDI at measuring biomass and structural change from wildfires using the 2020/21 summer fire seasons in Spain and Portugal. The GEDI hybrid-inference method was used to calculate mean and total biomass in pre- and post-fire stages, while GEDI footprint data was further used to explain the fire severity classes derived from optical data. Our results showed the increasing impact of wildfires on biomass stocks and GEDI ecological metrics by increasing fire severity. More than over biomass stocks, severe fires substantially altered trends in structural metrics such as plant area volume density. The integration of GEDI metrics to explain fire severity had an accuracy of 52\% considering five severity classes and an accuracy of 69\% when considering the three main classes: unburned, moderate and high. Structural metrics from GEDI can be used to improve optical-based fire severity estimates used globally and to evaluate potential fire impacts based on time-series of GEDI tracks as showcased in the study, but also to measure forest recovery between fire seasons. The extension of GEDI is a major support for wildfire mapping efforts, integrated approaches to capture the increasing impact of fire on forest biodiversity and the monitoring of changes in carbon stocks.},

	abstract = {Background and objective
Forests play a crucial role throughout the world as highly productive ecosystems, serving approximately a quarter of the human population by providing valuable services. However, these ecosystems are subject to various natural and human-induced disturbances such as insect outbreaks, fires, windthrow, snow damage, selective logging, and harvest, which significantly influence the composition and structure of forests. Recent studies have observed a notable increase in both natural and anthropogenic disturbances on a global scale. The availability of free Earth observation (EO) archives alongside the maturation of algorithms for analysing time series data have opened new opportunities to detect and understand forest disturbances in a vast spatio-temporal context. Over the past few decades, numerous EO-based approaches have been proposed to monitor forest ecosystems, benefiting from the open-data policies of multiple satellite constellations. This study conducted a mapping review to shed light on the state-of-the-art in forest disturbance characterization using EO big data.
Study design
We searched major online databases, including Scopus, the Web of Science, MDPI, Science Direct and IEEE Xplore, extensively in order to identify scientific literature published from 1995 to 2023. Of the more than 2000 records screened, 104 publications met the specific inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The selected studies were categorized based on the type of spatial and spectral-temporal patterns used to characterize forest disturbances, the predictors employed to classify the target disturbances, the data fusion methods applied when using multisource EO data, the classification algorithms employed and the accessibility of the reference data used in the studies.
Results
Our findings reveal that temporal patterns derived from spectral reflectance have been used three times more frequently than spatial patterns. The most common predictors were the spectral change magnitude and timing of disturbances derived from the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral region, along with measures of disturbed patch dimensions and elevation. The random forest emerged as the most used algorithm for classification. Furthermore, it was observed that less than 10\% of the studies provided or made available the datasets used for their analyses.
Conclusion
Although significant progress has been made in characterizing forest disturbances, the validity and credibility of results were found to be highly variable and much dependent on the choice of change detection methods, predictors and classification algorithms. The scarcity of research studies that provide access to their data poses a significant obstacle to the advancement of current methodologies and the development of novel approaches.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Forest fires contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions and can negatively affect public health, economic activity, and provision of ecosystem services. In boreal forests, fires are a part of the ecosystem dynamics, while in the humid tropics, fires are largely human-induced and lead to forest degradation. Studies have shown changing fire dynamics across the globe due to both climate and land use change. However, global trends in fire-related forest loss remain uncertain due to the lack of a globally consistent methodology applied to high spatial resolution data. Here, we create the first global 30-m resolution satellite-based map of annual forest loss due to fire. When producing this map, we match the mapped area of forest loss due to fire to the reference area obtained using a sample-based unbiased estimator, thus enabling map-based area reporting and trend analysis. We find an increasing global trend in forest loss due to fire from 2001 to 2019, driven by near-uniform increases across the tropics, subtropical, and temperate Australia, and boreal Eurasia. The results quantify the increasing threat of fires to remaining forests globally and may improve modeling of future forest fire loss rates under various climate change and development scenarios.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Tropical forest degradation from selective logging, fire and edge effects is a major driver of carbon and biodiversity loss1–3, with annual rates comparable to those of deforestation4. However, its actual extent and long-term impacts remain uncertain at global tropical scale5. Here we quantify the magnitude and persistence of multiple types of degradation on forest structure by combining satellite remote sensing data on pantropical moist forest cover changes4 with estimates of canopy height and biomass from spaceborne6 light detection and ranging (LiDAR). We estimate that forest height decreases owing to selective logging and fire by 15\% and 50\%, respectively, with low rates of recovery even after 20 years. Agriculture and road expansion trigger a 20\% to 30\% reduction in canopy height and biomass at the forest edge, with persistent effects being measurable up to 1.5 km inside the forest. Edge effects encroach on 18\% (approximately 206 Mha) of the remaining tropical moist forests, an area more than 200\% larger than previously estimated7. Finally, degraded forests with more than 50\% canopy loss are significantly more vulnerable to subsequent deforestation. Collectively, our findings call for greater efforts to prevent degradation and protect already degraded forests to meet the conservation pledges made at recent United Nations Climate Change and Biodiversity conferences.},

	abstract = {Forest structural complexity is a key element of ecosystem functioning, impacting light environments, nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and habitat quality. Addressing the need for a comprehensive global assessment of actual forest structural complexity, we derive a near-global map of 3D canopy complexity using data from the GEDI spaceborne lidar mission. These data show that tropical forests harbor most of the high complexity observations, while less than 20\% of temperate forests reached median levels of tropical complexity. Structural complexity in tropical forests is more strongly related to canopy attributes from lower and middle waveform layers, whereas in temperate forests upper and middle layers are more influential. Globally, forests exhibit robust scaling relationships between complexity and canopy height, but these vary geographically and by biome. Our results offer insights into the spatial distribution of forest structural complexity and emphasize the importance of considering biome-specific and fine-scale variations for ecological research and management applications. The GEDI Waveform Structural Complexity Index data product, derived from our analyses, provides researchers and conservationists with a single, easily interpretable metric by combining various aspects of canopy structure.},

	abstract = {More of the Amazon rainforest is disturbed each year than completely deforested, but the impact of these disturbances on the carbon cycle remains poorly understood. Recent algorithmic advances using optical and radar remote sensing have improved detection of disturbances at fine spatiotemporal resolution, but quantifying changes in forest structure and biomass associated with these detected disturbances has proven challenging. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), a spaceborne lidar mission collecting data from 2019 to 2023, provides an opportunity to address this problem. GEDI captured billions of measurements of forest height, plant area, and understory structure within ∼25-m diameter footprints scattered across the tropics. Though the instrument had no guaranteed repeat cycle, it sometimes sampled nearby locations twice; some of these spatially near-coincident footprints happened to measure forest structure before and after a detected disturbance, providing information on how disturbance affected aboveground biomass. In this study, we developed an efficient general-purpose open-source pipeline for identifying spatially coincident footprints, which is a computationally complex task, and used the pipeline to find over 13,700 footprint pairs with intervening disturbance events across the Amazon biome. We also identified a set of ∼65,000 spatially near-coincident footprint pairs that lacked an intervening disturbance but came from regions with similar disturbance threat; these provided a control dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of estimating forest structure and biomass changes with nearby footprints. Analysis of this Amazon-wide dataset demonstrated that GEDI was able to measure statistically significant canopy height and biomass deficits following non-stand-replacing disturbances as small as 900 m2 (30 m × 30 m). GEDI's unique three-dimensional view of forest structure also reflected the effects of different intensities of fire disturbance, including 20\% of burned areas where the upper canopy retained most of its height, but the understory suffered substantial foliage losses. Finally, we modeled the relationship between Landsat and Sentinel-1 disturbance detection parameters and GEDI-estimated percent biomass loss, showing that certain satellite-derived intensity metrics are correlated with increasing biomass loss and identifying temporal trends in biomass loss and recovery following disturbance. This work represents an important step towards the development of a pan-tropical, spatially explicit system for tracking carbon losses and structural changes arising from forest disturbance.},

	abstract = {Wildfires in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ) and other radioactively contaminated areas threaten human health and well-being with the potential to resuspend radionuclides. Wildfire behavior simulation is a necessary tool to examine the efficiency of fuel treatments in the CEZ, but it requires systematically updated maps of fuel types and canopy metrics. The objective of this study was to demonstrate an effective approach for mapping fuel types, canopy height (CH), and canopy cover (CC) in territories contaminated by radionuclides using Landsat time series (LTS) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR observations. We combined LTS and GEDI data to map fuel types and canopy metrics used in wildfire simulations within the CEZ. Our classification model showed an adequate overall accuracy (75\%) in mapping land covers and associated fuel types. The phenology metrics extracted from LTS reliably distinguished spectrally similar vegetation types (such as grasslands and croplands) which exhibit different flammability through the year. We also predicted a suite of relative heights metrics and CC at Landsat 30-m pixel level (R2 = 0.23–0.26) using the nearest neighbor technique. The imputed maps adequately captured the dynamics of CH and CC in the CEZ after recent large wildfires occurred in 2015, 2020, and 2022. Thus, we illustrate a LTS processing approach to produce wall-to-wall maps of canopy characteristics that are important for wildfire simulations. We conclude that continuous updating of land cover and canopy fuel data is crucial to ensure relevant fire management of radioactively contaminated landscapes and support local decision-making.},

	abstract = {The first Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) was launched in October 2011 aboard the Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite. The VIIRS instrument carries two separate sets of multi-spectral channels providing full global coverage at both 375m and 750m nominal resolutions every 12h or less depending on the latitude. In this study, we introduce a new VIIRS active fire detection algorithm, which is driven primarily by the 375m middle and thermal infrared imagery data. The algorithm builds on the well-established MODIS Fire and Thermal Anomalies product using a contextual approach to detect both day and nighttime biomass burning and other thermal anomalies. Here we present the fire algorithm's design and implementation, including important information describing the input data characteristics and potential artifacts associated with pixel saturation and the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly, both found to affect the middle infrared channel data. Initial assessment using results derived from the global processing of the algorithm indicated small, although variable, commission errors ({\textless}1.2\%) for nominal confidence fire pixels. We achieved improved performance using the 375m active fire data compared to the VIIRS 750m baseline fire product, resulting in a 3× and 25× factor increase in the absolute number of fire pixels detected using day and nighttime data, respectively. Similarly, VIIRS 375m fire data showed significantly superior mapping capabilities compared to current MODIS fire detection data with improved consistency of fire perimeter delineation for biomass burning lasting multiple days.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2311.11777},
	abstract = {The integration of multisource remote sensing data and deep learning models offers new possibilities for accurately mapping high spatial resolution forest height. We found that GEDI relative heights (RH) metrics exhibited strong correlation with the mean of the top 10 highest trees (dominant height) measured in situ at the corresponding footprint locations. Consequently, we proposed a novel deep learning framework termed the multi-modal attention remote sensing network (MARSNet) to estimate forest dominant height by extrapolating dominant height derived from GEDI, using Setinel-1 data, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, Sentinel-2 optical data and ancillary data. MARSNet comprises separate encoders for each remote sensing data modality to extract multi-scale features, and a shared decoder to fuse the features and estimate height. Using individual encoders for each remote sensing imagery avoids interference across modalities and extracts distinct representations. To focus on the efficacious information from each dataset, we reduced the prevalent spatial and band redundancies in each remote sensing data by incorporating the extended spatial and band reconstruction convolution modules in the encoders. MARSNet achieved commendable performance in estimating dominant height, with an R2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 2.82 m, outperforming the widely used random forest approach which attained an R2 of 0.55 and RMSE of 3.05 m. Finally, we applied the trained MARSNet model to generate wall-to-wall maps at 10 m resolution for Jilin, China. Through independent validation using field measurements, MARSNet demonstrated an R2 of 0.58 and RMSE of 3.76 m, compared to 0.41 and 4.37 m for the random forest baseline. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of a multimodal deep learning approach fusing GEDI with SAR and passive optical imagery for enhancing the accuracy of high resolution dominant height estimation.},

	abstract = {The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) instrument, as all FW systems, relies on very sophisticated pre-processing steps to generate a priori metrics in order to accurately estimate forest characteristics, such as forest heights and wood volume. The ever-expanding volume of acquired GEDI data, which to September 2020 comprised more than 25 billion shots, and requiring more than 90 TB of storage space, raises new challenges in terms of adapted preprocessing methods for the suitable exploitation of such a huge and complex amount of LiDAR data. Therefore, to avoid metric computation, we leveraged deep learning techniques in order to estimate canopy dominant heights (Hdom) and wood volume (V) of Eucalyptus plantations over five different regions in Brazil. Performance comparisons were conducted between a convolutional neural network based model that uses GEDI waveform data and a previously used, metric based, Random Forest regressor (RF). Cross-validated results showed that the CNN based model compared well against the RF counterpart for both Hdom and V. Indeed, the RMSE on the estimation of Hdom from the CNN based model was 1.61 m with a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.90, while the RF model produced an accuracy on Hdom estimates of 1.45 m(R2=0.92). For V, CNN based estimates was 27.35 m3.ha-1(R2 of 0.88), while for RF, the RMSE was 27.60 m3.ha-1 (R2=0.88).},

	abstract = {Nowadays Earth observation satellites provide forest fire authorities and resource managers with spatial and comprehensive information for fire stabilization and recovery. Burn severity mapping is typically performed by classifying bi-temporal indices (e.g., dNBR, and RdNBR) using thresholds derived from parametric models incorporating field-based measurements. Analysts are currently expending considerable manual effort using prior knowledge and visual inspection to determine burn severity thresholds. In this study, we aim to employ highly automated approaches to provide spatially explicit damage level estimates. We first reorganize a large-scale Landsat-based bi-temporal burn severity assessment dataset (Landsat-BSA) by visual data cleaning based on annotated MTBS data (approximately 1000 major fire events in the United States). Then we apply state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) based methods to map burn severity based on the Landsat-BSA dataset. Experimental results emphasize that multi-class semantic segmentation algorithms can approximate the threshold-based techniques used extensively for burn severity classification. UNet-like models outperform other region-based CNN and Transformer-based models and achieve accurate pixel-wise classification results. Combined with the online hard example mining algorithm to reduce class imbalance issue, Attention UNet achieves the highest mIoU (0.78) and the highest Kappa coefficient close to 0.90. The bi-temporal inputs with ancillary spectral indices work much better than the uni-temporal multispectral inputs. The restructured dataset will be publicly available and create opportunities for further advances in remote sensing and wildfire communities.},

	abstract = {Geographic information is essential for modeling tasks in fields ranging from ecology to epidemiology. However, extracting relevant location characteristics for a given task can be challenging, often requiring expensive data fusion or distillation from massive global imagery datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce Satellite Contrastive Location-Image Pretraining (SatCLIP). This global, general-purpose geographic location encoder learns an implicit representation of locations by matching CNN and ViT inferred visual patterns of openly available satellite imagery with their geographic coordinates. The resulting SatCLIP location encoder efficiently summarizes the characteristics of any given location for convenient use in downstream tasks. In our experiments, we use SatCLIP embeddings to improve prediction performance on nine diverse location-dependent tasks including temperature prediction, animal recognition, and population density estimation. Across tasks, SatCLIP consistently outperforms alternative location encoders and improves geographic generalization by encoding visual similarities of spatially distant environments. These results demonstrate the potential of vision-location models to learn meaningful representations of our planet from the vast, varied, and largely untapped modalities of geospatial data.},

	abstract = {Learning representations of geographical space is vital for any machine learning model that integrates geolocated data, spanning application domains such as remote sensing, ecology, or epidemiology. Recent work embeds coordinates using sine and cosine projections based on Double Fourier Sphere (DFS) features. These embeddings assume a rectangular data domain even on global data, which can lead to artifacts, especially at the poles. At the same time, little attention has been paid to the exact design of the neural network architectures with which these functional embeddings are combined. This work proposes a novel location encoder for globally distributed geographic data that combines spherical harmonic basis functions, natively defined on spherical surfaces, with sinusoidal representation networks (SirenNets) that can be interpreted as learned Double Fourier Sphere embedding. We systematically evaluate positional embeddings and neural network architectures across various benchmarks and synthetic evaluation datasets. In contrast to previous approaches that require the combination of both positional encoding and neural networks to learn meaningful representations, we show that both spherical harmonics and sinusoidal representation networks are competitive on their own but set state-of-the-art performances across tasks when combined.

	abstract = {Forests are continuously altered by disturbances. Yet, knowledge of global pattern of forest disturbance agents, its drivers, and shifts under changing climate remain scarce. Here we present a meta-analysis of current and projected (+2° and + 4 °C) distribution of forest disturbance agents causing immediate tree mortality (i.e., fire, pest outbreak, hydro-geomorphic, and wind) at country, continental, biome, and global scales. The model including combination of climatic (precipitation of driest quarter, actual evapotranspiration, and minimum temperature), geographical (distance to coast and topography complexity), and forest characteristics (tree density) performs better than any other model in explaining the distribution of disturbance agents (R2 = 0.74). We provide global maps (0.5° × 0.5°) of current and potential future distribution of forest disturbance agents. Globally, the most frequent disturbance agent was fire (46.09 \%), followed by pest outbreak (23.27 \%), hydro-geomorphic disturbances (18.97 \%), and wind (11.67 \%). Our projections indicate spatially contrasting shifts in disturbance agents, with fire and wind risk increase between {\textasciitilde}50°S and {\textasciitilde} 40°N under warming climate. In particular, the substantial increase in fire risk, exceeding 31 \% in the most affected areas, is projected over Mediterranean, the western and southeast USA, African, Oceanian, and South American forests. On the other hand, pest outbreak and hydro-geomorphic disturbances are projected to increase in more southern ({\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 50°S) and northern ({\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 40°N) latitudes. Our findings are critical for understanding ongoing changes and developing mitigation strategies to maintain the ecological integrity and ecosystem services under shifts in forest disturbances. We suggest that projected shifts in the global distribution of forest disturbance agents needs to be considered to future models of vegetation or carbon sink dynamics under projected climate change.},

	abstract = {With the advent of the next generation of space-based laser altimeters, ICESat-2 and GEDI, we are entering an exciting era of active remote sensing of forests that offers unprecedented opportunities for the observation of forest structure. Consistent comparisons of the accuracy of terrain and canopy height retrievals for these two missions are essential for continued improvement and further application. Because the time interval between the spaceborne products and validation data may introduce additional errors, we validate the newly released GEDI L2A product (version 2) and the ICESat-2 ATL08 product (version 4) using high-resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar products acquired in the same year (2019) as the reference datasets. In addition, our study area contains 40 sites located in the U.S. mainland, Alaska, and Hawaii that encompass a variety of eco-climatic zones and vegetation cover types; thus, it avoids the uncertainties associated with small sample sizes and restricted spatial coverage. The results show that ICESat-2 and GEDI yield reasonable estimates of terrain height, with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 2.24 and 4.03 m for mid and low latitudes, respectively, and 0.98 m for high latitudes (ICESat-2 only). ICESat-2 outperforms GEDI across the board for terrain height retrieval, although they both have better accuracy than existing SRTM and GMTED DEM products. Analyses of the error factors suggest that steep slopes ({\textgreater}30◦) present the greatest challenge for both GEDI and ICESat-2; in addition, tall ({\textgreater}20 m) and dense canopies ({\textgreater}90\%) forest ecosystems also reduce the accuracy of the terrain height estimates. When ICESat2 and GEDI data are used for canopy height retrieval, the use of only strong/power beam data acquired at night is recommended, as the overall RMSEs decrease from 7.21 and 5.02 m to 3.93 and 3.56 m, respectively, compared to using all data regardless of daytime and beam strength. GEDI outperforms ICESat-2 across the board for canopy height retrieval, as ICESat-2 has a larger potential bias for almost all forest types and cover conditions. ICESat-2 tends to overestimate the canopy height of dwarf shrublands and underestimate the canopy height of forest, and there is a gradual downward shift in the distribution of residuals with increasing canopy height. Overall, ICESat-2 with photon counting technology and GEDI with full waveform technology each represent the state of the art in spaceborne laser altimeters for terrain and canopy height retrieval. Combined, these two missions can take advantage of the unique strengths of each instrument.},

The GEDI vegetation height error is 5 m at the tropical sites, similar to the expected performance of the future spaceborne BIOMASS mission.

	abstract = {The increase in Earth observations from space in recent years supports improved quantification of carbon storage by terrestrial vegetation and fosters studies that relate satellite measurements to biomass retrieval algorithms. However, satellite observations are only indirectly related to the carbon stored by vegetation. While ground surveys provide biomass stock measurements to act as reference for training the models, they are sparsely distributed. Here, we addressed this problem by designing an algorithm that harnesses the interplay of satellite observations, modeling frameworks and field measurements, and generated global estimates of above-ground biomass (AGB) density that meet the requirements of the scientific community in terms of accuracy, spatial and temporal resolution. The design was adapted to the amount, type and spatial distribution of satellite data available around the year 2020. The retrieval algorithm estimated AGB annually by merging estimates derived from C- and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter observations with a Water Cloud type of model and does not rely on AGB reference data at the same spatial scale as the SAR data. This model is integrated with functions relating to forest structural variables that were trained on spaceborne LiDAR observations and subnational AGB statistics. The yearly estimates of AGB were successively harmonized using a cost function that minimizes spurious fluctuations arising from the moderate-to-weak sensitivity of the SAR backscatter to AGB. The spatial distribution of the AGB estimates was correctly reproduced when the retrieval model was correctly set. Over-predictions occasionally occurred in the low AGB range ({\textless}50 Mg ha 1) and under-predictions in the high AGB range ({\textgreater}300 Mg ha 1). These errors were a consequence of sometimes too strong generalizations made within the modeling framework to allow reliable retrieval worldwide at the expense of accuracy. The precision of the estimates was mostly between 30\% and 80\% relative to the estimated value. While the framework is well founded, it could be improved by incorporating additional satellite observations that capture structural properties of vegetation (e.g., from SAR interferometry, low-frequency SAR, or high-resolution observations), a dense network of regularly monitored high-quality forest biomass reference sites, and spatially more detailed characterization of all model parameters estimates to better reflect regional differences.},

	abstract = {Earth Observation data are uniquely positioned to estimate forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD) in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) principles of ‘transparency, accuracy, completeness, consistency and comparability’. However, the use of space-based AGBD maps for national-level reporting to the UNFCCC is nearly non-existent as of 2023, the end of the first global stocktake (GST). We conduct an evidence-based comparison of AGBD estimates from the NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation and ESA Climate Change Initiative, describing differences between the products and National Forest Inventories (NFIs), and suggesting how science teams must align efforts to inform the next GST. Between the products, in the tropics, the largest differences in estimated AGBD are primarily in the Congolese lowlands and east/southeast Asia. Where NFI data were acquired (Peru, Mexico, Lao PDR and 30 regions of Spain), both products show strong correlation to NFI-estimated AGBD, with no systematic deviations. The AGBD-richest stratum of these, the Peruvian Amazon, is accurately estimated in both. These results are remarkably promising, and to support the operational use of AGB map products for policy reporting, we describe targeted ways to align products with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. We recommend moving towards consistent statistical terminology, and aligning on a rigorous framework for uncertainty estimation, supported by the provision of open-science codes for large-area assessments that comprehensively report uncertainty. Further, we suggest the provision of objective and open-source guidance to integrate NFIs with multiple AGBD products, aiming to enhance the precision of national estimates. Finally, we describe and encourage the release of user-friendly product documentation, with tools that produce AGBD estimates directly applicable to the IPCC guideline methodologies. With these steps, space agencies can convey a comparable, reliable and consistent message on global biomass estimates to have actionable policy impact.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Large-scale fire emission estimates may be influenced by the spatial resolution of the model and input datasets used. Especially in areas with relatively heterogeneous land cover, a coarse model resolution might lead to substantial errors in estimates. We developed a model using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations of burned area and vegetation characteristics to study the impact of spatial resolution on modelled fire emission estimates. We estimated fire emissions for sub-Saharan Africa at 500 m spatial resolution (native MODIS burned area) for the 2002–2017 period, using a simplified version of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) modelling framework, and compared this to model runs at a range of coarser resolutions (0.050, 0.125, 0.250∘). We estimated fire emissions of 0.68 Pg C yr−1 at 500 m resolution and 0.82 Pg C yr−1 at 0.25∘ resolution; a difference of 24 \%. At 0.25∘ resolution, our model results were relatively similar to GFED4, which also runs at 0.25∘ resolution, whereas our 500 m estimates were substantially lower. We found that lower emissions at finer resolutions are mainly the result of reduced representation errors when comparing modelled estimates of fuel load and consumption to field measurements, as part of the model calibration. Additional errors stem from the model simulation at coarse resolution and lead to an additional 0.02 Pg C yr−1 difference in estimates. These errors exist due to the aggregation of quantitative and qualitative model input data; the average- or majority- aggregated values are propagated in the coarse-resolution simulation and affect the model parameterization and the final result. We identified at least three error mechanisms responsible for the differences in estimates between 500 m and 0.25∘ resolution simulations, besides those stemming from representation errors in the calibration process, namely (1) biome misclassification leading to errors in parameterization, (2) errors due to the averaging of input data and the associated reduction in variability, and (3) a temporal mechanism related to the aggregation of burned area in particular. Even though these mechanisms largely neutralized each other and only modestly affect estimates at a continental scale, they lead to substantial error at regional scales with deviations of up to a factor 4 and may affect large-scale estimates differently for other continents. These findings could prove valuable in improving coarse-resolution models and suggest the need for increased spatial resolution in global fire emission models.},

Across the southern Amazon, 19,700 deforestation fire events accounted for 39\% of all satellite active fire detections and the majority of fire carbon emissions (63\%; 69 Tg C). Multiday fires accounted for 81\% of burned area and 92\% of carbon emissions from the Amazon, with many forest fires burning uncontrolled for weeks. Most fire detections from deforestation fires were correctly identified within 2 days (67\%), highlighting the potential to improve situational awareness and management outcomes during fire emergencies.},

	abstract = {Long-term records of burned area are needed to understand wildfire dynamics, assess fire impacts on ecosystems and air quality, and improve fire forecasts. Here, we fuse multiple streams of remote sensing data to create a 24 year (1997–2020) dataset of monthly burned area as a component of the fifth version of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED5). During 2001–2020, we use the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD64A1 burned area product and adjust for the errors of commission and omission. Adjustment factors are estimated based on region, land cover, and tree cover fraction, using spatiotemporally aligned burned area from Landsat or Sentinel-2. Burned area in croplands, peatlands, and deforestation regions is estimated from MODIS active fire detections. Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) and Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) active fire data are used to extend the time series back to 1997. The global annual burned area during 2001–2020 is estimated to be 774 ± 63 Mha yr−1 or 5.9 ± 0.5 \% of ice-free land. Burned area declined by 1.21 ± 0.66 \% yr−1, a cumulative decrease of 24.2 ± 13.2 \% over 20 years. The global reduction is primarily driven by a decrease in fires in savannas, grasslands, and croplands. Forest, peat, and deforestation fires did not exhibit significant long-term trends. The GFED5 global burned area is 93 \% higher than MCD64A1, 61 \% higher than GFED4s, and in closer agreement with products from higher-resolution satellite sensors. These data may reduce discrepancies between fire emission estimates from activity-based and atmospheric-based approaches, and improve our understanding of global fire impacts on the carbon cycle and climate system.

This paper aims to illustrate an integrated modelling approach combining spatial and non-spatial inputs to provide and enhance the estimation of GHG and particulate matter emissions from surface fires using Italy as a case study over the period 2007–2017. Three main improvements characterize the approach proposed in this work: (i) the collection and development of comprehensive and accurate data inputs related to burned area; (ii) the use of the most recent data on fuel type and load; and (iii) the modelling application to estimate fuel moisture, burning efficiency, and fuel consumption considering meteorological factors and combustion phases. On average, Italy's GHG and particulate matter emissions were 2621 Gg yr−1, ranging from a minimum of 772 Gg yr−1 in 2013 to a maximum of 7020 Gg yr−1 in 2007. Emissions from fire disturbances in broadleaf forests, shrublands, and agricultural fuel types account for about 76 \% of the total. Results were compared with global and national inventories and showed good agreement, especially considering CO2 and particulate matter. The approach of this study added confidence in emission estimates, and the results can be utilized in decision support systems to address air quality management and fire impact mitigation policies.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing techniques are effectively used for measuring the overall loss of terrestrial ecosystem productivity and biodiversity due to forest fires. The current research focuses on assessing the impacts of forest fires on terrestrial ecosystem productivity in India during 2003–2017. Spatiotemporal changes of satellite remote sensing derived burn indices were estimated for both fire and normal years to analyze the association between forest fires and ecosystem productivity. Two Light Use Efficiency (LUE) models were used to quantify the terrestrial Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of the forest ecosystem using the open-source and freely available remotely sensed data. A novel approach (delta NPP/delta burn indices) is developed to quantify the effects of forest fires on terrestrial carbon emission and ecosystem production. During 2003–2017, the forest fire intensity was found to be very high ({\textgreater}2000) across the eastern Himalayan hilly region, which is mostly covered by dense forest and thereby highly susceptible to wildfires. Scattered patches of intense forest fires were also detected in the lower Himalayan and central Indian states. The spatial correlation between the burn indices and NPP were mainly negative (−0.01 to −0.89) for the fire-prone states as compared to the other neighbouring regions. Additionally, the linear approximation between the burn indices and NPP showed a positive relation (0.01 to 0.63), suggesting a moderate to high impact of the forest fires on the ecosystem production and terrestrial carbon emission. The present approach has the potential to quantify the loss of ecosystem productivity due to forest fires.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic carbon emissions directly contribute to global warming, which has induced severe environmental concerns like extreme droughts and devastating fires. To evaluate the effects of fires on carbon cycling and climate change, it is crucial to accurately estimate the amount of carbon released during fires. The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission offers spaceborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements of global forests, providing excellent opportunities for monitoring forest dynamics and carbon emissions. The ICESat-2 Land and vegetation height product (ATL08), Landsat 8 data, and Sentinel-1 data were integrated to estimate biomass burning emissions with a three-phase hierarchy model. In Phase 1, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to establish the relationship between ATL08 LiDAR metrics and reference aboveground biomass (AGB), R2 0.77 and RMSE 56.67 Mg ha−1. In Phase 2, the LASSO regression predicted AGB for all ATL08 segments. A Random Forest Regression model was trained with Landsat 8 reflectance data and derived vegetation indices, Sentinel-1 data, and terrain variables as predictors and with the LASSO predicted AGB as the response variable, R2 0.71 and RMSE 45.91 Mg ha−1. Wall-to-wall maps of pre-fire and post-fire AGB were produced with the Random Forest model. In Phase 3, the difference between the pre-fire and the post-fire AGB was converted to carbon emissions. The estimated biomass burning emissions of the 2018 Carr fire group, the 2018 Camp fire, and the 2019 Walker fire in California are 3.54 (± 0.067) Tg C, 1.66 (± 0.041) Tg C, and 0.45 (± 0.022) Tg C, respectively. Forests have the highest biomass burning emissions with an average emission of 30.09 Mg ha−1, approximately twice and four times the average emissions from shrubs and grasses. This study highlights the merit of integrating spaceborne remote sensing data, including LiDAR data, optical data, and radar data, for estimating biomass burning emissions, opening an avenue for accurate forest biomass and carbon dynamics monitoring, as well as climate change mitigation.},

	abstract = {Wildfires have been progressively shrinking the C sink capacity of forest accelerating climate change effects on forest biodiversity, especially where megafires are recurrent and of increased frequency such as in the Mediterranean. Data from The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission can inform on changes on forest structure to inform on fire impacts on vegetation. In this study, we assessed the performance of GEDI at measuring biomass and structural change from wildfires using the 2020/21 summer fire seasons in Spain and Portugal. The GEDI hybrid-inference method was used to calculate mean and total biomass in pre- and post-fire stages, while GEDI footprint data was further used to explain the fire severity classes derived from optical data. Our results showed the increasing impact of wildfires on biomass stocks and GEDI ecological metrics by increasing fire severity. More than over biomass stocks, severe fires substantially altered trends in structural metrics such as plant area volume density. The integration of GEDI metrics to explain fire severity had an accuracy of 52\% considering five severity classes and an accuracy of 69\% when considering the three main classes: unburned, moderate and high. Structural metrics from GEDI can be used to improve optical-based fire severity estimates used globally and to evaluate potential fire impacts based on time-series of GEDI tracks as showcased in the study, but also to measure forest recovery between fire seasons. The extension of GEDI is a major support for wildfire mapping efforts, integrated approaches to capture the increasing impact of fire on forest biodiversity and the monitoring of changes in carbon stocks.},

	abstract = {Background and objective
Forests play a crucial role throughout the world as highly productive ecosystems, serving approximately a quarter of the human population by providing valuable services. However, these ecosystems are subject to various natural and human-induced disturbances such as insect outbreaks, fires, windthrow, snow damage, selective logging, and harvest, which significantly influence the composition and structure of forests. Recent studies have observed a notable increase in both natural and anthropogenic disturbances on a global scale. The availability of free Earth observation (EO) archives alongside the maturation of algorithms for analysing time series data have opened new opportunities to detect and understand forest disturbances in a vast spatio-temporal context. Over the past few decades, numerous EO-based approaches have been proposed to monitor forest ecosystems, benefiting from the open-data policies of multiple satellite constellations. This study conducted a mapping review to shed light on the state-of-the-art in forest disturbance characterization using EO big data.
Study design
We searched major online databases, including Scopus, the Web of Science, MDPI, Science Direct and IEEE Xplore, extensively in order to identify scientific literature published from 1995 to 2023. Of the more than 2000 records screened, 104 publications met the specific inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The selected studies were categorized based on the type of spatial and spectral-temporal patterns used to characterize forest disturbances, the predictors employed to classify the target disturbances, the data fusion methods applied when using multisource EO data, the classification algorithms employed and the accessibility of the reference data used in the studies.
Results
Our findings reveal that temporal patterns derived from spectral reflectance have been used three times more frequently than spatial patterns. The most common predictors were the spectral change magnitude and timing of disturbances derived from the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral region, along with measures of disturbed patch dimensions and elevation. The random forest emerged as the most used algorithm for classification. Furthermore, it was observed that less than 10\% of the studies provided or made available the datasets used for their analyses.
Conclusion
Although significant progress has been made in characterizing forest disturbances, the validity and credibility of results were found to be highly variable and much dependent on the choice of change detection methods, predictors and classification algorithms. The scarcity of research studies that provide access to their data poses a significant obstacle to the advancement of current methodologies and the development of novel approaches.},

In boreal forests, fires are a part of the ecosystem dynamics, while in the humid tropics, fires are largely human-induced and lead to forest degradation. Studies have shown changing fire dynamics across the globe due to both climate and land use change. However, global trends in fire-related forest loss remain uncertain due to the lack of a globally consistent methodology applied to high spatial resolution data. Here, we create the first global 30-m resolution satellite-based map of annual forest loss due to fire. When producing this map, we match the mapped area of forest loss due to fire to the reference area obtained using a sample-based unbiased estimator, thus enabling map-based area reporting and trend analysis. We find an increasing global trend in forest loss due to fire from 2001 to 2019, driven by near-uniform increases across the tropics, subtropical, and temperate Australia, and boreal Eurasia. The results quantify the increasing threat of fires to remaining forests globally and may improve modeling of future forest fire loss rates under various climate change and development scenarios.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Tropical forest degradation from selective logging, fire and edge effects is a major driver of carbon and biodiversity loss1–3, with annual rates comparable to those of deforestation4. However, its actual extent and long-term impacts remain uncertain at global tropical scale5. Here we quantify the magnitude and persistence of multiple types of degradation on forest structure by combining satellite remote sensing data on pantropical moist forest cover changes4 with estimates of canopy height and biomass from spaceborne6 light detection and ranging (LiDAR). We estimate that forest height decreases owing to selective logging and fire by 15\% and 50\%, respectively, with low rates of recovery even after 20 years. Agriculture and road expansion trigger a 20\% to 30\% reduction in canopy height and biomass at the forest edge, with persistent effects being measurable up to 1.5 km inside the forest. Edge effects encroach on 18\% (approximately 206 Mha) of the remaining tropical moist forests, an area more than 200\% larger than previously estimated7. Finally, degraded forests with more than 50\% canopy loss are significantly more vulnerable to subsequent deforestation. Collectively, our findings call for greater efforts to prevent degradation and protect already degraded forests to meet the conservation pledges made at recent United Nations Climate Change and Biodiversity conferences.},

Addressing the need for a comprehensive global assessment of actual forest structural complexity, we derive a near-global map of 3D canopy complexity using data from the GEDI spaceborne lidar mission. These data show that tropical forests harbor most of the high complexity observations, while less than 20\% of temperate forests reached median levels of tropical complexity. Structural complexity in tropical forests is more strongly related to canopy attributes from lower and middle waveform layers, whereas in temperate forests upper and middle layers are more influential. Globally, forests exhibit robust scaling relationships between complexity and canopy height, but these vary geographically and by biome. Our results offer insights into the spatial distribution of forest structural complexity and emphasize the importance of considering biome-specific and fine-scale variations for ecological research and management applications. The GEDI Waveform Structural Complexity Index data product, derived from our analyses, provides researchers and conservationists with a single, easily interpretable metric by combining various aspects of canopy structure.},

	abstract = {More of the Amazon rainforest is disturbed each year than completely deforested, but the impact of these disturbances on the carbon cycle remains poorly understood. Recent algorithmic advances using optical and radar remote sensing have improved detection of disturbances at fine spatiotemporal resolution, but quantifying changes in forest structure and biomass associated with these detected disturbances has proven challenging. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), a spaceborne lidar mission collecting data from 2019 to 2023, provides an opportunity to address this problem. GEDI captured billions of measurements of forest height, plant area, and understory structure within ∼25-m diameter footprints scattered across the tropics. Though the instrument had no guaranteed repeat cycle, it sometimes sampled nearby locations twice; some of these spatially near-coincident footprints happened to measure forest structure before and after a detected disturbance, providing information on how disturbance affected aboveground biomass. In this study, we developed an efficient general-purpose open-source pipeline for identifying spatially coincident footprints, which is a computationally complex task, and used the pipeline to find over 13,700 footprint pairs with intervening disturbance events across the Amazon biome. We also identified a set of ∼65,000 spatially near-coincident footprint pairs that lacked an intervening disturbance but came from regions with similar disturbance threat; these provided a control dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of estimating forest structure and biomass changes with nearby footprints. Analysis of this Amazon-wide dataset demonstrated that GEDI was able to measure statistically significant canopy height and biomass deficits following non-stand-replacing disturbances as small as 900 m2 (30 m × 30 m). GEDI's unique three-dimensional view of forest structure also reflected the effects of different intensities of fire disturbance, including 20\% of burned areas where the upper canopy retained most of its height, but the understory suffered substantial foliage losses. Finally, we modeled the relationship between Landsat and Sentinel-1 disturbance detection parameters and GEDI-estimated percent biomass loss, showing that certain satellite-derived intensity metrics are correlated with increasing biomass loss and identifying temporal trends in biomass loss and recovery following disturbance. This work represents an important step towards the development of a pan-tropical, spatially explicit system for tracking carbon losses and structural changes arising from forest disturbance.},

Wildfire behavior simulation is a necessary tool to examine the efficiency of fuel treatments in the CEZ, but it requires systematically updated maps of fuel types and canopy metrics. The objective of this study was to demonstrate an effective approach for mapping fuel types, canopy height (CH), and canopy cover (CC) in territories contaminated by radionuclides using Landsat time series (LTS) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR observations. We combined LTS and GEDI data to map fuel types and canopy metrics used in wildfire simulations within the CEZ. Our classification model showed an adequate overall accuracy (75\%) in mapping land covers and associated fuel types. The phenology metrics extracted from LTS reliably distinguished spectrally similar vegetation types (such as grasslands and croplands) which exhibit different flammability through the year. We also predicted a suite of relative heights metrics and CC at Landsat 30-m pixel level (R2 = 0.23–0.26) using the nearest neighbor technique. The imputed maps adequately captured the dynamics of CH and CC in the CEZ after recent large wildfires occurred in 2015, 2020, and 2022. Thus, we illustrate a LTS processing approach to produce wall-to-wall maps of canopy characteristics that are important for wildfire simulations. We conclude that continuous updating of land cover and canopy fuel data is crucial to ensure relevant fire management of radioactively contaminated landscapes and support local decision-making.},

However, direct observations of how fire frequency influences vegetation structure and post-fire recovery have been limited to small experimental field studies. Here, we combined lidar-derived canopy height and canopy cover from NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 with over two decades of burned area data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensors to provide the first biome-wide estimates of post-fire changes in canopy structure for major vegetation types in the Cerrado (Brazil). Mean canopy height decreased with increasing burn frequency for all natural cover types, with the greatest decline observed for forests and savannas. The ability to separate changes in fractional canopy cover from height growth using lidar data highlighted the long-time scales of vegetation recovery in forests and savannas after fire. For forests in medium and high precipitation areas, canopy cover returned to unburned values within 5 years following fire, whereas mean canopy height remained below unburned values, even in the oldest fires (14–20 years). Recovery times increased with decreasing rainfall, with average values of both fractional cover and canopy height below unburned areas after 14–20 years for savannas. We observed gradual recovery of vegetation height and cover over decades, even in mesic or wet savanna regions like the Cerrado. Infrequent fire activity, particularly in areas with greater land management, influences ecosystem structure across the biome, with important consequences for biodiversity conservation.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the resilience to fire off several plant communities with reference to the temporal evolution of their vertical structural diversity (VSD) estimated from the data fusion of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter (Sentinel-1) and multispectral remote sensing reflectance (Sentinel-2) in a burned landscape of the western Mediterranean Basin. We estimated VSD in the field 1 and 2 years after fire using Shannon's index as a measure of vertical heterogeneity in vegetation structure from the vegetation cover in several strata, both in burned and unburned control plots. Random forest (RF) was used to model VSD in the control (analogous to prefire scenario) and burned plots (1 year after fire) using as predictors (i) Sentinel-1 VV and VH backscatter coefficients and (ii) surface reflectance of Sentinel-2 bands. The transferability of the RF model from 1 to 2 years after wildfire was also evaluated. We generated VSD prediction maps across the study site for the prefire scenario and 1 to 4 years postfire. RF models accurately explained VSD in unburned control plots (R2 = 87.68; RMSE = 0.16) and burned plots 1 year after fire (R2 = 80.48; RMSE = 0.13). RF model transferability only involved a reduction in the VSD predictive capacity from 0.13 to 0.20 in terms of RMSE. The VSD of each plant community 4 years after the fire disturbance was significantly lower than in the prefire scenario. Plant communities dominated by resprouter species featured significantly higher VSD recovery values than communities dominated by facultative or obligate seeders. Our results support the applicability of SAR and multispectral data fusion for monitoring VSD as a generalizable resilience indicator in fire-prone landscapes.},

In this study, we investigate the potential of data from two spaceborne lidar altimetry missions, ICESat-2 and GEDI—with respect to their vertical accuracies and planimetric data collection patterns—as sources for rasterisation towards creating global DEMs. We validate the terrain measurements of both missions against airborne lidar datasets over three areas in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and New Zealand and differentiate them using land-cover classes. For our experiments, we use five years of ICESat-2 ATL03 data and four years of GEDI L2A data for a total of 252 million measurements. The datasets are filtered using parameter flags provided by the higher-level products ICESat-2 ATL08 and GEDI L3A. For all areas and land-cover classes combined, ICESat-2 achieves a bias of −0.11 m, an MAE of 0.43 m, and an RMSE of 0.93 m. From our experiments, we find that GEDI is less accurate, with a bias of 0.09 m, an MAE of 0.98 m, and an RMSE of 2.96 m. Measurements in open land-cover classes, such as “Cropland” and “Grassland”, result in the best accuracy for both missions. We also find that the slope of the terrain has a major influence on vertical accuracy, more so for GEDI than ICESat-2 because of its larger horizontal geolocation error. In contrast, we find little effect of either beam power or background solar radiation, nor do we find noticeable seasonal effects on accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate the spatial coverage of ICESat-2 and GEDI by deriving a DEM at different horizontal resolutions and latitudes. GEDI has higher spatial coverage than ICESat-2 at lower latitudes due to its beam pattern and lower inclination angle, and a derived DEM can achieve a resolution of 500 m. ICESat-2 only reaches a DEM resolution of 700 m at the equator, but it increases to almost 200 m at higher latitudes. When combined, a 500 m resolution lidar-based DEM can be achieved globally. Our results indicate that both ICESat-2 and GEDI enable accurate terrain measurements anywhere in the world. Especially in data-poor areas—such as the tropics—this has potential for new applications and insights.},

	abstract = {The Amazon forest is fire sensitive, but, where fires were uncommon as a natural disturbance, deforestation and drought are accelerating fire occurrences, which threaten the integrity of the tropical forest, the carbon cycle and air quality. Fire emissions depend on fuel amount and type, moisture conditions and burning behaviour. Higher-resolution satellite data have helped more accurately map global burnt areas; however, the effects of fuels on the combustion process and on the composition of fire emissions remain uncertain in current fire emissions inventories. By using multiple Earth observation-based approaches, here we show that total fire emissions in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes are dominated by smouldering combustion of woody debris. The representation of woody debris and surface litter presents a critical uncertainty in fire emissions inventories and global vegetation models. For the fire season 1 August to 31 October 2020, for which all approaches are available, we found \$\$372{\textasciicircum}\{605\}\_\{277\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Tg\}\$\$(median and range across approaches) of dry matter burnt, corresponding to carbon monoxide emissions of \$\$39.1{\textasciicircum}\{59\}\_\{27\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Tg\}\$\$. Our results emphasize how Earth observation approaches for fuel and fire dynamics and of atmospheric trace gases reduce uncertainties of fire emission estimates. The findings enable diagnosing the representation of fuels, wildfire combustion and its effects on atmospheric composition and the carbon cycle in global vegetation–fire models.},

	abstract = {Two novel satellite LiDAR missions —GEDI and ICESat-2— are currently operational and combined provide near-global measurements of forest height and structure. Such data underpin a new era of large-area approaches for measuring forest height in regrowing forests of different ages and assessing associated regrowth rates. Two LiDAR missions further allow for comparing independently derived forest heights and regrowth rates. This study utilized both GEDI and ICESat-2 measurements to assess regrowth rates in regrowing forests of different ages for the Brazilian state Rondônia. We considered 19 data subgroups stratified by beam strength, light condition, beam sensitivity, and waveform processing algorithm to assess the retrieval uncertainty and identify data subgroups associated with the most reliable regrowth estimates. The quality assessment of GEDI and ICESat-2 forest heights over four 50 km long airborne LiDAR strips determined a root mean square error of 4.14 m (CV = 17\%) and 5.91 m (CV = 19\%) and a mean error of 0.04 m and −2.81 m, respectively. A linear calibration model between satellite- and airborne-LiDAR heights was then derived for each data subgroup and used to calibrate satellite heights. Forest regrowth rates were subsequently estimated for each satellite mission using a space-for-time imputation with forest heights’ medians per stand age class. The total growth of GEDI and ICESat-2 median forest heights after 33 years was 20.17 m (SE = 1.3 m) and 20.13 m (SE = 2.8 m), respectively. However, when growth was approximated with different non-linear models, the total growth differed by up to 6\%, and the average regrowth rate even by up to 23\%. The study revealed that omitting either the calibration step or the removal of secondary-forest-border pixels would result in an underestimation of the regrowth rate by more than 20\%. Furthermore, the ICESat-2 weak beams were found unreliable for regrowth retrieval. The study showed that the novel satellite LiDAR data and the proposed methods could assess median forest height growth over large areas. However, forest age errors should also be accounted for in the retrieval uncertainty before comparing the growth estimates across different regions.

Second, no data source provides, by itself, global coverage at a suitable temporal recurrence. Thus, global monitoring initiatives, such as assessment of essential biodiversity variables (EBVs), will necessarily have to involve the combination of disparate data sets. We propose a standardized framework of ecosystem morphological traits – height, cover, and structural complexity – that could enable monitoring of globally consistent EBVs at regional scales, by flexibly integrating different information sources – satellites, aircrafts, drones, or ground data – allowing global biodiversity targets relating to ecosystem structure to be monitored and regularly reported.},

	abstract = {Climate change and increasing human activities are impacting ecosystems and their biodiversity. Quantitative measurements of essential biodiversity variables (EBV) and essential climate variables are used to monitor biodiversity and carbon dynamics and evaluate policy and management interventions. Ecosystem structure is at the core of EBVs and carbon stock estimation and can help to inform assessments of species and species diversity. Ecosystem structure is also used as an indirect indicator of habitat quality and expected species richness or species community composition. Spaceborne measurements can provide large-scale insight into monitoring the structural dynamics of ecosystems, but they generally lack consistent, robust, timely and detailed information regarding their full three-dimensional vegetation structure at local scales. Here we demonstrate the potential of high-frequency ground-based laser scanning to systematically monitor structural changes in vegetation. We present a proof-of-concept high-temporal ecosystem structure time series of 5 years in a temperate forest using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). We also present data from automated high-temporal laser scanning that can allow upscaling of vegetation structure scanning, overcoming the limitations of a typically opportunistic TLS measurement approach. Automated monitoring will be a critical component to build a network of field monitoring sites that can provide the required calibration data for satellite missions to effectively monitor the structural dynamics of vegetation over large areas. Within this perspective, we reflect on how this network could be designed and discuss implementation pathways.},

	abstract = {In fire-prone regions, wildfire influences spatial and temporal patterns of landscape heterogeneity. The likely impacts of climate change on the frequency and intensity of wildfire highlights the importance of understanding how fire-induced heterogeneity may affect different components of the biota. Here, we examine the influence of wildfire, as an agent of landscape heterogeneity, on the distribution of arboreal mammals in fire-prone forests in south-eastern Australia. First, we used a stratified design to examine the role of topography, and the relative influence of fire severity and fire history, on the occurrence of arboreal mammals 2–3 years after wildfire. Second, we investigated the influence of landscape context on the occurrence of arboreal mammals at severely burnt sites. Forested gullies supported a higher abundance of arboreal mammals than slopes. Fire severity was the strongest influence, with abundance lower at severely burnt than unburnt sites. The occurrence of mammals at severely burned sites was influenced by landscape context: abundance increased with increasing amount of unburnt and understorey-only burnt forest within a 1 km radius. These results support the hypothesis that unburnt forest and moist gullies can serve as refuges for fauna in the post-fire environment and assist recolonization of severely burned forest. They highlight the importance of spatial heterogeneity created by wildfire and the need to incorporate spatial aspects of fire regimes (e.g., creation and protection of refuges) for fire management in fire-prone landscapes.},

	abstract = {The “Height Variation Hypothesis” is an indirect approach used to estimate forest biodiversity through remote sensing data, stating that greater tree height heterogeneity (HH) measured by CHM LiDAR data indicates higher forest structure complexity and tree species diversity. This approach has traditionally been analyzed using only airborne LiDAR data, which limits its application to the availability of the dedicated flight campaigns. In this study we analyzed the relationship between tree species diversity and HH, calculated with four different heterogeneity indices using two freely available CHMs derived from the new space-borne GEDI LiDAR data. The first, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, was produced through a regression tree machine learning algorithm integrating GEDI LiDAR data and Landsat optical information. The second, with a spatial resolution of 10 m, was created using Sentinel-2 images and a deep learning convolutional neural network. We tested this approach separately in 30 forest plots situated in the northern Italian Alps, in 100 plots in the forested area of Traunstein (Germany) and successively in all the 130 plots through a cross-validation analysis. Forest density information was also included as influencing factor in a multiple regression analysis. Our results show that the GEDI CHMs can be used to assess biodiversity patterns in forest ecosystems through the estimation of the HH that is correlated to the tree species diversity. However, the results also indicate that this method is influenced by different factors including the GEDI CHMs dataset of choice and their related spatial resolution, the heterogeneity indices used to calculate the HH and the forest density. Our finding suggest that GEDI LIDAR data can be a valuable tool in the estimation of forest tree heterogeneity and related tree species diversity in forest ecosystems, which can aid in global biodiversity estimation.},

	abstract = {The distribution of different vegetation types is important information for landscape management, especially in the context of tackling global environmental change. Vegetation types can be mapped using satellite and airborne passive remote sensing. However, spectrally similar yet structurally different vegetation types, like different tree-dominated land covers, are often challenging to map using spectral information alone. We examined the potential of vertical vegetation structure acquired in the global ecosystem dynamics investigation (GEDI) mission that harnesses a space-borne waveform lidar sensor in vegetation mapping across a heterogeneous tropical landscape in Cambodia. We extracted 121 waveform metrics from Level-1B and Level-2A data products at 1062 locations across five key vegetation types. After reducing the relative height variables’ dimensionality through simple linear regressions, we developed a Random Forest classifier to predict vegetation classes based on 23 GEDI metrics. We then used this model to classify the vegetation types across more than 77 000 GEDI footprints in the study area. GEDI metrics alone were useful in identifying vegetation types with 81\% accuracy. Cropland/grassland class had the highest prediction accuracy (user’s accuracy [UA] = 89\%; producer’s accuracy [PA] = 91\%), while dry deciduous forest had the lowest accuracy (UA = 73\%; PA = 69\%). By comparing the GEDI-only classification with an optical-radar map, we found that structural and topographic information from GEDI Level-1B and Level-2A can complement the spectral information in assessing natural habitats that neighbor other vegetation types in a heterogeneous landscape. The highest classification accuracy at the footprint scale was obtained from the combination of GEDI, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 (88.3\%). We also demonstrated how wall-to-wall vegetation mapping is possible by combining the three data sources. These findings expand the potential use of GEDI waveform lidar data in supporting the development of policy-relevant maps that depict the distribution of forests together with other vegetation types.},

Here, we quantified GEDI's potential to estimate forest structure in mountain landscapes at the plot and landscape level, with a focus on variables of high relevance in ecological applications. We compared five GEDI metrics including relative height percentiles, plant area index, cover and understory cover to airborne laser scanning (ALS) data in two contrasting mountain landscapes in the European Alps. At the plot level, we investigated the impact of leaf phenology and topography on GEDI's accuracy. At the landscape-scale, we evaluated the ability of GEDIs sample-based approach to characterize complex mountain landscapes by comparing it to wall-to-wall ALS estimates and evaluated the capacity of GEDI to quantify important indicators of ecosystem functions and services (i.e., avalanche protection, habitat provision, carbon storage). Our results revealed only weak to moderate agreement between GEDI and ALS at the plot level (R2 from 0.03 to 0.61), with GEDI uncertainties increasing with slope. At the landscape-level, however, the agreement between GEDI and ALS was generally high, with R2 values ranging between 0.51 and 0.79. Both GEDI and ALS agreed in identifying areas of high avalanche protection, habitat provision, and carbon storage, highlighting the potential of GEDI for landscape-scale analyses in the context of ecosystem dynamics and management.},

	abstract = {Plant biodiversity supports life on Earth and provides a range of important ecosystem services, but is under severe pressure by global change. Structural diversity plays a crucial role for carbon, water and energy cycles and animal habitats. However, it is very difficult to map and monitor over large areas, limiting our ability to assess the status of biodiversity and predict change. NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provides a new opportunity to measure 3D plant canopy structure of the world’s temperate, Mediterranean and tropical ecosystems, but its potential to map structural diversity is not yet tested. Here, we use wall-to-wall airborne laser scanning (ALS) to simulate GEDI data (GEDIsim) over 7380 km2 in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains in California and evaluate how well GEDI’s sampling scheme captures patterns of structural diversity. We evaluate functional richness and functional beta diversity in a biodiversity hot spot. GEDIsim performed well for trait retrievals (r2 = 0.68) and functional richness mapping (r2 = 0.75) compared to ALS retrievals, despite lower correlations in complex terrain with steep slopes. Functional richness patterns were strongly associated with soil organic carbon stocks and density as well as variables related to water availability and could be appropriately mapped by GEDIsim with and without cloud cover. Functional beta diversity was more strongly related to local changes in topography and more challenging to map, especially with decreasing sampling density. The reduced number of GEDIsim shots when simulating cloud cover lead to a strong overestimation of beta diversity and a reduction of r2 from 0.64 to 0.40 compared to ALS. The ability to map functional richness has been demonstrated with potential application at continental scales that could be transformative for our understanding of large-scale patterns of plant canopy structure, diversity and potential links to animal diversity, movement and habitats.},

	abstract = {Aboveground biomass (AGB) mapping using spaceborne LiDAR data and multi-sensor images is essential for efficient carbon monitoring and climate change mitigation actions in heterogeneous forests. The optimal predictors of remote sensing-based AGB vary greatly with geographic stratification, such as topography and forest type, while the way in which geographic stratification influences the contributions of predictor variables in object-based AGB mapping is insufficiently studied. To address the improvement of mapping forest AGB by geographic stratification in heterogeneous forests, satellite multisensory data from global ecosystem dynamics investigation (GEDI) and series of advanced land observing satellite (ALOS) and Sentinel were integrated. Multi-sensor predictors for the AGB modeling of different types of forests were selected using a correlation analysis of variables calculated from topographically stratified objects. Random forests models were built with GEDI-based AGB and geographically stratified predictors to acquire wall-to-wall biomass values. It was illustrated that the mapped biomass had a similar distribution and was approximate to the sampled forest AGB. Through an accuracy comparison using independent validation samples, it was determined that the geographic stratification approach improved the accuracy by 34.79\% compared to the unstratified process. Stratification of forest type further increased the mapped AGB accuracy compared to that of topography. Topographical stratification greatly influenced the predictors’ contributions to AGB mapping in mixed broadleaf–conifer and broad-leaved forests, but only slightly impacted coniferous forests. Optical variables were predominant for deciduous forests, while for evergreen forests, SAR indices outweighed the other predictors. As a pioneering estimation of forest AGB with geographic stratification using satellite multisensory data, this study offers optimal predictors and an advanced method for obtaining carbon maps in heterogeneous regional landscapes.},

	abstract = {Forest structure, notably the canopy height above the ground, can be obtained from the full-waveform data acquired by satellite laser altimetry. On sloped terrain, the laser pulse can simultaneously reflect from both the vegetation and the ground within their intersecting vertical extents, causing their signals to overlap. This overlap complicates the separation of canopy and ground in the analysis. Consequently, accurately obtaining canopy height and its variation, while considering the influence of terrain factors, poses a significant challenge. In this paper, to counter this, we introduce an innovative approach to remove terrain effects for more reliable identification of canopy and ground. Overlapping footprints from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat)/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) campaigns are extracted as coincidental observations. Utilizing the different footprint sizes and by minimizing the center and width of each decomposed Gaussian component pair, optimized ground returns can be obtained. Validation using airborne LiDAR data from the Bartlett Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA, indicate that the proposed approach can reduce the ground elevation root-mean-square error (RMSE) by approximately 3 m, compared to the prevalent methods and standard products. While the GEDI product algorithms exhibit a certain accuracy in canopy height retrieval, the proposed approach presents a more constrained error band, signifying less impact from ground elevation discrepancies. While the proposed method enhances canopy height precision, its reliance on overlapping footprints means sacrificing some observations. However, the proposed method is effective in scenarios such as change detection that require repeat observations. As a case study, we applied the proposed method in Porto Velho, Rondônia, Brazil, which is a deforestation hotspot. Using the GlobeLand30 dataset, we investigated the land-cover dynamics from co-located laser footprints, identifying significant forest loss areas and validating our findings with the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset, achieving an accuracy of 83.81 \%. In conclusion, this research emphasizes the significance of terrain topography effects in vegetation structure analysis, and positions satellite laser altimetry as instrumental for forest monitoring.},

	abstract = {Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a lidar system on-board the International Space Station designed to study forest ecosystems. However, GEDI footprint low accuracy geolocation is a major impediment to the optimal benefit of the data. We thus proposed a geolocation correction method, GeoGEDI, only based on high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and GEDI derived ground elevations. For each footprint, an error map between GEDI ground estimates and reference DEM was computed, and a flow accumulation algorithm was used to retrieve the optimal footprint position. GeoGEDI was tested on 150 000 footprints in Landes and Vosges, two French forests with various stands and topographic conditions. It was applied to GEDI versions 1 (v1) and 2 (v2), by either a single or four full-power laser beam tracks. GeoGEDI output accuracy was evaluated by analyzing shift distributions and comparing GEDI ground elevations and surface heights to reference data. GeoGEDI corrections were greater for v1 than for v2 and agreed with errors published by NASA. Within forests, GeoGEDI improved the root mean square error (RMSE) of ground elevation in Landes by 26.8\% (0.34 m) and by 13.3\% (0.14 m) for v1 and v2, respectively. For Vosges, ground elevation RMSE improved by 59.6\% (3.82 m) and 36.2\% (1.41 m), for v1 and v2, respectively. Regarding surface heights, except for v2 in Landes, where insufficient variations in topography combined to GEDI ground detection issues might have penalized the adjustment, GeoGEDI improved GEDI estimates. Using GeoGEDI showed efficient to improve positioning bias and precision.},

In the four years of operation to date, the GEDI instrument has provided unprecedented observations for global forest height and forest above-ground biomass estimation studies. However, it remains a daunting challenge to obtain accurate canopy height estimates based on GEDI observations in topographically undulating areas. Studies on how to make full use of the actual topographic conditions within each GEDI footprint, to aid in canopy height extraction, are still lacking. In this article, we propose a method based on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM)-simulated ground echo for assisting in ground waveform identification and canopy top elevation correction, which in turn improves the accuracy of the maximum canopy height extraction in topographically undulating areas. The validation results show that the accuracy of the ground elevation, canopy top elevation, and maximum canopy height obtained by the proposed method is improved by 9.2\%, 15\%, and 14\%, respectively, compared with the GEDI L2A product. Since the only auxiliary data used in this approach are the publicly available SRTM DEM product data, the proposed method has the potential to be applied to large regions or even globally.

	abstract = {Quantifying ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks is essential for better understanding the global carbon cycle and improving projections of the carbon-climate feedbacks. Remote sensing has played a vital role in this endeavor during the last five decades by quantifying carbon fluxes and stocks. The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective and insights for future research and directions in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in carbon cycling studies in the future. This comprehensive and insightful review on 50 years of remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle is timely and valuable and can benefit scientists in various research communities (e.g., carbon cycle, remote sensing, climate change, ecology) and inform ecosystem and carbon management, carbon-climate projections, and climate policymaking.},

	abstract = {Passive and active spaceborne remote sensing technologies play a key role in monitoring forests across large areas, particularly when combining the advantages of both sensor technologies. This study investigates the link between spectral and structural change metrics following forest fire disturbance, collected from Landsat satellites and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission, respectively. The relationships were analysed across 1849 GEDI sampling locations (footprints), spread across south-east Australian forests. To assess structural change on the footprint level, simulated pre-fire GEDI observations were compared with real GEDI observations from one year after the fires. Results show relatively strong fire responses across Landsat spectral indices, with a median decline to between 46.1 \% (Normalised Burn Ratio 2) and 77 \% (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) of pre-fire levels. GEDI’s structural change metrics demonstrated a markedly different response, with most showing an even more pronounced decline. In contrast, canopy height demonstrated a less substantial decline, dropping to 82.7 \%. Results also suggest that fire severity and forest type impact the fire response of some of the examined spectral and structural metrics. In particular, taller forests and increased fire severity were associated with a more pronounced post-fire decline. The findings of this study highlight the large variation of forest structural responses to fire and their divergence from spectral change metrics, and emphasise the potential of integrating GEDI observations into wall-to-wall spectral forest change monitoring. The concept of bi-temporal GEDI observations as demonstrated in this study is promising, as it captures both pre- and post-disturbance structure on the footprint level and might enhance modelling of forest structural change in future approaches.},

We propose a probabilistic deep learning approach based on an ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to avoid the explicit modelling of unknown effects, such as atmospheric noise. The model learns to extract robust features that generalize to unseen geographical regions and, in addition, yields reliable estimates of predictive uncertainty.

This model retrieves canopy-top height from Sentinel-2 images anywhere on Earth and quantifies the uncertainty in these estimates. Our approach improves the retrieval of tall canopies with typically high carbon stocks. According to our map, only 5\% of the global landmass is covered by trees taller than 30 m. Further, we find that only 34\% of these tall canopies are located within protected areas. Thus, the approach can serve ongoing efforts in forest conservation and has the potential to foster advances in climate, carbon and biodiversity modelling.},

This has resulted in the availability of multiple, sometimes conflicting, sources of information, but, at face value, it also makes it possible to learn about forest attribute uncertainty through the joint interpretation of multiple models. This article seeks to endorse the latter by utilizing the Bayesian model averaging approach to diagnose and interpret the differences between predictions from different models. The predictions in our case are forest canopy height estimations for metropolitan France arising from five different models. An independent reference dataset, containing four different definitions of forest height (dominant, mean, maximum, and Lorey's) was established based on around 5500 plots of the French National Forest Inventory (NFI), distributed across the entire area of interest. In this study, we evaluate models with respect to their probabilities of correctly predicting measurements or estimations obtained from NFI plots, highlighting the spatial variability in respective model probabilities across the study area. We observed significant variability in these probabilities depending on the forest height definition used, implying that the different models inadvertently predict different types of canopy height. We also present the respective inter-model and intra-model variance estimations, enabling us to grasp where the employed models have comparable contributions but contrasting predictions. We show that topography has an important impact on the models spread. Moreover, we observed that the forest stand vertical structure, the dominant tree species, and the type of forest ownership systematically emerge as statistically significant factors influencing the model divergences. Finally, we observed that the fitted higher-order mixtures, which enabled the presented analyses, do not necessarily reduce bias or prevent the saturation of the predicted heights observed in the individual models.},

In this study, we sought to assess new global three-dimensional Earth observation data acquired by the spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) missions Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI). For this, we examined the “ATLAS/ICESat-2 L3A Land and Vegetation Height”, version 5 (20 × 14 m and 100 × 14 m segments) and the “GEDI Level 2A Footprint Elevation and Height Metrics”, version 2 (25 m circle). We conducted our analysis across four land cover classes (bare soil, herbaceous, forest, savanna), and six forest types (temperate broad-leaved, temperate needle-leaved, temperate mixed, tropical upland, tropical floodplain, and tropical secondary forest). For assessment of terrain elevation estimates from spaceborne LiDAR data we used high resolution airborne data. Our results indicate that both LiDAR missions provide accurate terrain elevation estimates across different land cover classes and forest types with mean error less than 1 m, except in tropical forests. However, using a GEDI algorithm with a lower signal end threshold (e.g., algorithm 5) can improve the accuracy of terrain elevation estimates for tropical upland forests. Specific environmental parameters (terrain slope, canopy height and canopy cover) and sensor parameters (GEDI degrade flags, terrain estimation algorithm; ICESat-2 number of terrain photons, terrain uncertainty) can be applied to improve the accuracy of ICESat-2 and GEDI-based terrain estimates. Although the goodness-of-fit statistics from the two spaceborne LiDARs are not directly comparable since they possess different footprint sizes (100 × 14 m segment or 20 × 14 m segment vs. 25 m circle), we observed similar trends on the impact of terrain slope, canopy cover and canopy height for both sensors. Terrain slope strongly impacts the accuracy of both ICESat-2 and GEDI terrain elevation estimates for both forested and non-forested areas. In the case of GEDI the impact of slope is, however, partly caused by horizontal geolocation error. Moreover, dense canopies (i.e., canopy cover higher than 90\%) affect the accuracy of spaceborne LiDAR terrain estimates, while canopy height does not, when considering samples over flat terrains. Our analysis of the accuracy and precision of current versions of spaceborne LiDAR products for different vegetation types and environmental conditions provides insights on parameter selection and estimated uncertainty to inform users of these key global datasets.},

	abstract = {Paramos, unique and biodiverse ecosystems found solely in the high mountain regions of the tropics, are under threat. Despite their crucial role as primary water sources and significant carbon repositories in Colombia, they are deteriorating rapidly and garner less attention than other vulnerable ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest. Their fertile soil and unique climate make them prime locations for agriculture and cattle grazing, often coinciding with economically critical deposits such as coal which has led to a steady decline in paramo area. Anthropic impact was evaluated using multispectral images from Landsat and Sentinel over 37 years, on the Guerrero and Rabanal paramos in central Colombia which have experienced rapid expansion of mining and agriculture. Our analysis revealed that since 1984, the Rabanal and Guerrero paramos have lost 47.96\% and 59.96\% of their native vegetation respectively, replaced primarily by crops, pastures, and planted forests. We detected alterations in the spectral signatures of native vegetation near coal coking ovens, indicating a deterioration of paramo health and potential impact on ecosystem services. Consequently, human activity is reducing the extent of paramos and their efficiency as water sources and carbon sinks, potentially leading to severe regional and even global consequences.},

Páramos have been regularly burned for many years, and it is not clear how páramo vegetation will respond to significant changes in their fire regimes. This study investigates differences in plant growth form composition, light levels and soil temperatures in páramo plots representing a range of recovery times since the last fire. Location Reserva Ecológica El Ángel and La Bretaña Nature Reserve, Carchi, Northern Ecuador. Methods We assessed the frequency of ten páramo growth forms, vegetation height, soil temperature, and light intensity in fifteen fire sites with historical records of fire ({\textless}1–15 years since fire), and one recently unburned site (at least 40 years since fire). A chronosequence of sites was used to assess potential changes in plant community composition in post-fire succession of páramo. Results The recovery of páramo vegetation after fire comprised three phases: initial recruitment with high growth form diversity, followed by reduced diversity, light and soil temperatures in dense tussock vegetation, and ultimately canopy height stratification with a return of diversity. All but one of the plant growth forms were represented in each of the three phases, and the changes reflected differences in relative abundance. Conclusions Post-fire páramo succession is characterised by clear shifts in the relative abundance of plant growth forms, ending with (co-)dominance of upright shrubs. The long-term consequences of such shifts for biodiversity and ecosystem function, given the widespread adoption of fire suppression policies in the páramo, need careful, evidence-based consideration.},

	abstract = {NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a spaceborne lidar mission which will produce near global (51.6°S to 51.6°N) maps of forest structure and above-ground biomass density during its 2-year mission. GEDI uses a waveform simulator for calibration of algorithms and assessing mission accuracy. This paper implements a waveform simulator, using the method proposed in Blair and Hofton (1999; https://doi.org/10.1029/1999GL010484), and builds upon that work by adding instrument noise and by validating simulated waveforms across a range of forest types, airborne laser scanning (ALS) instruments, and survey configurations. The simulator was validated by comparing waveform metrics derived from simulated waveforms against those derived from observed large-footprint, full-waveform lidar data from NASA's airborne Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS). The simulator was found to produce waveform metrics with a mean bias of less than 0.22 m and a root-mean-square error of less than 5.7 m, as long as the ALS data had sufficient pulse density. The minimum pulse density required depended upon the instrument. Measurement errors due to instrument noise predicted by the simulator were within 1.5 m of those from observed waveforms and 70–85\% of variance in measurement error was explained. Changing the ALS survey configuration had no significant impact on simulated metrics, suggesting that the ALS pulse density is a sufficient metric of simulator accuracy across the range of conditions and instruments tested. These results give confidence in the use of the simulator for the pre-launch calibration and performance assessment of the GEDI mission.},

Developing approaches to assess these effects in highly-degraded tropical forests is necessary, especially at large scales. In this study, we developed a framework to upscale NASA’s GEDI spaceborne lidar AGB products using data from imaging sensors in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest – one of the most degraded and fragmented ecosystems in the world. A Random Forest model was trained using GEDI footprint level AGB as response and vegetation indices from Landsat 8/OLI and ALOS/PALSAR-2 images as predictors. The models were used to map and assess the AGB at the core and edge of 8783 fragments. The model had r = 0.83 and RMSE = 34.06 Mg/ha. The AGB in the fragments’ edges were significantly lower than in the fragments’ cores. The results demonstrated the potential of the developed framework to assess fragmentation effects on highly degraded tropical forest ecosystems.},

Large-scale trends in ecosystems where vegetation has adapted to infrequent fire, especially in cooler and wetter forested areas, are less well understood. Here, small changes in fire regimes can have a substantial impact on local biogeochemistry5. To investigate trends in fire across a wide range of ecosystems, we used Bayesian inference6 to quantify four primary controls on burnt area: fuel continuity, fuel moisture, ignitions and anthropogenic suppression. We found that fuel continuity and moisture are the dominant limiting factors of burnt area globally. Suppression is most important in cropland areas, whereas savannahs and boreal forests are most sensitive to ignitions. We quantify fire regime shifts in areas with more than one, and often counteracting, trends in these controls. Forests are of particular concern, where we show average shifts in controls of 2.3–2.6\% of their potential maximum per year, mainly driven by trends in fuel continuity and moisture. This study gives added importance to understanding long-term future changes in the controls on fire and the effect of fire trends on ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {The distribution of fire on Earth has been monitored from space for several decades, yet the geography of global fire regimes has proven difficult to reproduce from interactions of climate, vegetation, terrain, land use and other human activities by empirical and process-based fire models. Here, we propose a simple, yet robust, model for the global distribution of fire potential based on fundamental biophysical constraints controlling fire activity in all biomes. In our ‘top-down’ approach we ignored the dynamics of individual fires and focus on capturing hydroclimatic constraints on the production and (seasonal) desiccation of fuels to predict the potential mean annual fractional burned area at 0.25° spatial resolution, here estimated by the 0.99 quantile of the observed mean annual fractional burned area () over the 1995-2016 period of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4). We show that 80\% of the global variation in can be explained from a combination of mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. The proposed hydroclimatic model reproduced observed 0.99 quantile fire activity levels equally well across all biomes and provided the first objective underpinning for the dichotomy of global fire regimes in two domains characterised by either fuel production limitations on fire or fuel dryness limitations on fire. A sharp transition between the two climate-fire domains was found to occur at a mean annual aridity index of 1.9 (1.94 ± 0.02). Our model provides a simple but comprehensive basis for predicting fire potential under current and future climates, as well as an overarching framework for estimating effects of human activity via ignition regimes and manipulation of vegetation.},

We use an atmospheric inversion system to show that global fire emissions have been stable or slightly decreasing despite the substantial decline in global burned area over the past two decades caused by the carbon dioxide emission increase from forest fires offsetting the decreasing emissions from grass and shrubland fires. Forest fires are larger carbon dioxide sources per unit area burned than grassland fires, with a slow or incomplete follow-up recovery—sometimes no recovery due to degradation and deforestation. With fires expanding over forest areas, the slow recovery of carbon dioxide uptake over burned forest lands weakens land sink capacity, implying positive feedback on climate change.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Forest fires contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions and can negatively affect public health, economic activity, and provision of ecosystem services. In boreal forests, fires are a part of the ecosystem dynamics, while in the humid tropics, fires are largely human-induced and lead to forest degradation. Studies have shown changing fire dynamics across the globe due to both climate and land use change. However, global trends in fire-related forest loss remain uncertain due to the lack of a globally consistent methodology applied to high spatial resolution data. Here, we create the first global 30-m resolution satellite-based map of annual forest loss due to fire. When producing this map, we match the mapped area of forest loss due to fire to the reference area obtained using a sample-based unbiased estimator, thus enabling map-based area reporting and trend analysis. We find an increasing global trend in forest loss due to fire from 2001 to 2019, driven by near-uniform increases across the tropics, subtropical, and temperate Australia, and boreal Eurasia. The results quantify the increasing threat of fires to remaining forests globally and may improve modeling of future forest fire loss rates under various climate change and development scenarios.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Climate, land use, and other anthropogenic and natural drivers have the potential to influence fire dynamics in many regions. To develop a mechanistic understanding of the changing role of these drivers and their impact on atmospheric composition, long-term fire records are needed that fuse information from different satellite and in situ data streams. Here we describe the fourth version of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) and quantify global fire emissions patterns during 1997–2016. The modeling system, based on the Carnegie–Ames–Stanford Approach (CASA) biogeochemical model, has several modifications from the previous version and uses higher quality input datasets. Significant upgrades include (1) new burned area estimates with contributions from small fires, (2) a revised fuel consumption parameterization optimized using field observations, (3) modifications that improve the representation of fuel consumption in frequently burning landscapes, and (4) fire severity estimates that better represent continental differences in burning processes across boreal regions of North America and Eurasia. The new version has a higher spatial resolution (0.25°) and uses a different set of emission factors that separately resolves trace gas and aerosol emissions from temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. Global mean carbon emissions using the burned area dataset with small fires (GFED4s) were 2.2 × 1015 grams of carbon per year (Pg C yr−1) during 1997–2016, with a maximum in 1997 (3.0 Pg C yr−1) and minimum in 2013 (1.8 Pg C yr−1). These estimates were 11 \% higher than our previous estimates (GFED3) during 1997–2011, when the two datasets overlapped. This net increase was the result of a substantial increase in burned area (37 \%), mostly due to the inclusion of small fires, and a modest decrease in mean fuel consumption (−19 \%) to better match estimates from field studies, primarily in savannas and grasslands. For trace gas and aerosol emissions, differences between GFED4s and GFED3 were often larger due to the use of revised emission factors. If small fire burned area was excluded (GFED4 without the s for small fires), average emissions were 1.5 Pg C yr−1. The addition of small fires had the largest impact on emissions in temperate North America, Central America, Europe, and temperate Asia. This small fire layer carries substantial uncertainties; improving these estimates will require use of new burned area products derived from high-resolution satellite imagery. Our revised dataset provides an internally consistent set of burned area and emissions that may contribute to a better understanding of multi-decadal changes in fire dynamics and their impact on the Earth system. GFED data are available from http://www.globalfiredata.org.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Forest fires contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions and can negatively affect public health, economic activity, and provision of ecosystem services. In boreal forests, fires are a part of the ecosystem dynamics, while in the humid tropics, fires are largely human-induced and lead to forest degradation. Studies have shown changing fire dynamics across the globe due to both climate and land use change. However, global trends in fire-related forest loss remain uncertain due to the lack of a globally consistent methodology applied to high spatial resolution data. Here, we create the first global 30-m resolution satellite-based map of annual forest loss due to fire. When producing this map, we match the mapped area of forest loss due to fire to the reference area obtained using a sample-based unbiased estimator, thus enabling map-based area reporting and trend analysis. We find an increasing global trend in forest loss due to fire from 2001 to 2019, driven by near-uniform increases across the tropics, subtropical, and temperate Australia, and boreal Eurasia. The results quantify the increasing threat of fires to remaining forests globally and may improve modeling of future forest fire loss rates under various climate change and development scenarios.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The saturation of spectral reflectance within densely vegetated regions is a renowned challenge that has precluded the optimal use of broad-band remotely sensed data and its derivatives for vegetation monitoring. While several reviews on the remote sensing of biomass have been published to date, an attempt to document and better understand the spectral reflectance saturation of vegetation has largely remained elusive. This article provides a comprehensive bibliometric assessment of the spectral reflectance saturation problem. The review profiles historical developments and maps the current remote sensing landscape of high-density Aboveground biomass and Leaf Area Index, with emphasis on the physical principles, proxies and methodologies as well as exploring the challenges and opportunities thereof. The review showed a skewed distribution of research between the Global North and South as well as variability in signal saturation levels of sensors according to the type, structure, and species composition of vegetation. Signal saturation is also dependent on the type of sensor used with the wavelength position and polarisation playing a pivotal role. The review also showed frequent usage of SAR backscatter and Lidar-based sensors for large-scale mapping, particularly in forests as compared to optical sensors. The fusion of waveform lidar indices with other sensors provides unprecedented opportunities for solving signal saturation problems. While used at localised and laboratory scales, narrow-band vegetation indices from hyperspectral sensors also significantly improved high-density biomass estimation. It is concluded that despite improvements generally in sensor capabilities and algorithm development, there is no uniform method for improving biomass estimation in dense vegetation. This calls for further research on understanding the fundamental relationship between spectral reflectance measurements and vegetation type, leaf orientation, vertical and horizontal structural parameters in dense vegetated regions. The development of appropriate sensors, fusion of optical and microwave data and improvement of retrieval approaches that transcend vegetation types and their associated traits is critical.},

At the very least, we recommend that natural forest be differentiated from plantations and that for defining “forest” the lower height limit defining “trees” be set at more than 5 m tall with the minimum cover of trees be set at more than 40\%. These changes will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from what is now termed forest “degradation” without increasing monitoring costs. Furthermore, these minor changes in the definition of “forest” will promote the switch from degradation to responsible forest management, which will help mitigate global warming while protecting biodiversity and contributing to sustainable development.},

	abstract = {Societal Impact Statement Large areas of tropical forest are degraded. While global tree cover is being mapped with increasing accuracy from space, much less is known about the quality of that tree cover. Here we present a field protocol for rapid assessments of forest condition. Using extensive field data from Tanzania, we show that a focus on remotely-sensed deforestation would not detect significant reductions in forest quality. Radar-based remote sensing of degradation had good agreement with the ground data, but the ground surveys provided more insights into the nature and drivers of degradation. We recommend the combined use of rapid field assessments and remote sensing to provide an early warning, and to allow timely and appropriately targeted conservation and policy responses. Summary Tropical forest degradation is widely recognised as a driver of biodiversity loss and a major source of carbon emissions. However, in contrast to deforestation, more gradual changes from degradation are challenging to detect, quantify and monitor. Here, we present a field protocol for rapid, area-standardised quantifications of forest condition, which can also be implemented by non-specialists. Using the example of threatened high-biodiversity forests in Tanzania, we analyse and predict degradation based on this method. We also compare the field data to optical and radar remote-sensing datasets, thereby conducting a large-scale, independent test of the ability of these products to map degradation in East Africa from space. Our field data consist of 551 ‘degradation’ transects collected between 1996 and 2010, covering {\textgreater}600 ha across 86 forests in the Eastern Arc Mountains and coastal forests. Degradation was widespread, with over one-third of the study forests—mostly protected areas—having more than 10\% of their trees cut. Commonly used optical remote-sensing maps of complete tree cover loss only detected severe impacts (≥25\% of trees cut), that is, a focus on remotely-sensed deforestation would have significantly underestimated carbon emissions and declines in forest quality. Radar-based maps detected even low impacts ({\textless}5\% of trees cut) in 90\% of cases. The field data additionally differentiated types and drivers of harvesting, with spatial patterns suggesting that logging and charcoal production were mainly driven by demand from major cities. Rapid degradation surveys and radar remote sensing can provide an early warning and guide appropriate conservation and policy responses. This is particularly important in areas where forest degradation is more widespread than deforestation, such as in eastern and southern Africa.},

The regrowth index for each structural parameter includes regrowth ratios and rates at 5-year intervals spanning primarily from 1985 to 2020.

Such observations are critical for accurately assessing the existing biomass of forests, and how changes in this biomass caused by human activities or variations in climate may impact atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Additionally, the three-dimensional structure of forests is a key component of habitat quality and biodiversity at local to regional scales. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) was launched to the International Space Station in late 2018 to provide high-quality measurements of forest vertical structure in temperate and tropical forests between 51.6° N \& S latitude. The GEDI instrument is a geodetic-class laser altimeter/waveform lidar comprised of 3 lasers that produce 8 transects of structural information. Over its two-year nominal lifetime GEDI is anticipated to provide over 10 billion waveforms at a footprint resolution of 25 ​m. These data will be used to derive a variety of footprint and gridded products, including canopy height, canopy foliar profiles, Leaf Area Index (LAI), sub-canopy topography and biomass. Additionally, data from GEDI are used to demonstrate the efficacy of its measurements for prognostic ecosystem modeling, habit and biodiversity studies, and for fusion using radar and other remote sensing instruments. GEDI science and technology are unique: no other space-based mission has been created that is specifically optimized for retrieving vegetation vertical structure. As such, GEDI promises to advance our understanding of the importance of canopy vertical variations within an ecological paradigm based on structure, composition and function.},

	abstract = {NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is collecting spaceborne full waveform lidar data with a primary science goal of producing accurate estimates of forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD). This paper presents the development of the models used to create GEDI’s footprint-level ({\textasciitilde}25 m) AGBD (GEDI04\_A) product, including a description of the datasets used and the procedure for final model selection. The data used to fit our models are from a compilation of globally distributed spatially and temporally coincident field and airborne lidar datasets, whereby we simulated GEDI-like waveforms from airborne lidar to build a calibration database. We used this database to expand the geographic extent of past waveform lidar studies, and divided the globe into four broad strata by Plant Functional Type (PFT) and six geographic regions. GEDI’s waveform-to-biomass models take the form of parametric Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models with simulated Relative Height (RH) metrics as predictor variables. From an exhaustive set of candidate models, we selected the best input predictor variables, and data transformations for each geographic stratum in the GEDI domain to produce a set of comprehensive predictive footprint-level models. We found that model selection frequently favored combinations of RH metrics at the 98th, 90th, 50th, and 10th height above ground-level percentiles (RH98, RH90, RH50, and RH10, respectively), but that inclusion of lower RH metrics (e.g. RH10) did not markedly improve model performance. Second, forced inclusion of RH98 in all models was important and did not degrade model performance, and the best performing models were parsimonious, typically having only 1-3 predictors. Third, stratification by geographic domain (PFT, geographic region) improved model performance in comparison to global models without stratification. Fourth, for the vast majority of strata, the best performing models were fit using square root transformation of field AGBD and/or height metrics. There was considerable variability in model performance across geographic strata, and areas with sparse training data and/or high AGBD values had the poorest performance. These models are used to produce global predictions of AGBD, but will be improved in the future as more and better training data become available.},

We aggregated over 7 billion lidar shots from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) to produce analysis-ready, gridded rasters of 36 vegetation structure metrics at three spatial resolutions (1, 6, and 12 km). We used 8 statistics to grid shots in every pixel, specifically the mean, bootstrapped standard error of the mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile range, Shannon’s Diversity Index, and shot count. We quantified uncertainty of the mean by randomly selecting 100 subsets of shots (i.e. bootstrapping) within each pixel. We also assessed the accuracy of several gridded metrics using fine spatial resolution airborne laser scanning data. The gridded metrics are generally more accurate at mid latitudes due to higher shot density and lower density of vegetation. Statistics associated with the central or maximum tendency of a metric are more accurate than statistics related to variability of metric values within the pixel.},

	abstract = {To make advances in the fire discipline, as well as in the study of CO2 emissions, it is of great interest to develop a global database with estimators of the degree of biomass consumed by fire, which is defined as burn severity. In this work we present the first global burn severity database (MOSEV database), which is based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance and burned area (BA) products from November 2000 to near real time. To build the database we combined Terra MOD09A1 and Aqua MYD09A1 surface reflectance products to obtain dense time series of the normalized burn ratio (NBR) spectral index, and we used the MCD64A1 product to identify BA and the date of burning. Then, we calculated for each burned pixel the difference of the NBR (dNBR) and its relativized version (RdNBR), as well as the post-burn NBR, which are the most commonly used burn severity spectral indices. The database also includes the pre-burn NBR used for calculations, the date of the pre- and post-burn NBR, and the date of burning. Moreover, in this work we have compared the burn severity metrics included in MOSEV (dNBR, RdNBR and post-burn NBR) with the same ones obtained from Landsat-8 scenes which have an original resolution of 30 m. We calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficients and the significance of the relationships using 13 pairs of Landsat scenes randomly distributed across the globe, with a total BA of 6904 km2 (n=32 163). Results showed that MOSEV and Landsat-8 burn severity indices are highly correlated, particularly the post-burn NBR (R=0.88; P\&lt;0.001), and dNBR (R=0.74; P\&lt;0.001) showed stronger relationships than RdNBR (R=0.42; P\&lt;0.001). Differences between MOSEV and Landsat-8 indices are attributable to variability in reflectance values and to the different temporal resolution of both satellites (MODIS: 1–2 d; Landsat: 16 d). The database is structured according to the MODIS tiling system and is freely downloadable at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4265209 (Alonso-González and Fernández-García, 2020).},

	abstract = {Forest fires, while destructive and dangerous, are important to the functioning and renewal of ecosystems. Over the past 2 decades, large-scale, severe forest fires have become more frequent globally, and the risk is expected to increase as fire weather and drought conditions intensify. To improve quantification of the intensity and extent of forest fire damage, we have developed a 30 m resolution global forest burn severity (GFBS) dataset of the degree of biomass consumed by fires from 2003 to 2016. To develop this dataset, we used the Global Fire Atlas product to determine when and where forest fires occurred during that period and then we overlaid the available Landsat surface reflectance products to obtain pre-fire and post-fire normalized burn ratios (NBRs) for each burned pixel, designating the difference between them as dNBR and the relative difference as RdNBR. We compared the GFBS dataset against the Canada Landsat Burned Severity (CanLaBS) product, showing better agreement than the existing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)-based global burn severity dataset (MOdis burn SEVerity, MOSEV) in representing the distribution of forest burn severity over Canada. Using the in situ burn severity category data available for the 2013 wildfires in southeastern Australia, we demonstrated that GFBS could provide burn severity estimation with clearer differentiation between the high-severity and moderate-/low-severity classes, while such differentiation among the in situ burn severity classes is not captured in the MOSEV product. Using the CONUS-wide composite burn index (CBI) as a ground truth, we showed that dNBR from GFBS was more strongly correlated with CBI (r=0.63) than dNBR from MOSEV (r=0.28). RdNBR from GFBS also exhibited better agreement with CBI (r=0.56) than RdNBR from MOSEV (r=0.20). On a global scale, while the dNBR and RdNBR spatial patterns extracted by GFBS are similar to those of MOSEV, MOSEV tends to provide higher burn severity levels than GFBS. We attribute this difference to variations in reflectance values and the different spatial resolutions of the two satellites. The GFBS dataset provides a more precise and reliable assessment of burn severity than existing available datasets. These enhancements are crucial for understanding the ecological impacts of forest fires and for informing management and recovery efforts in affected regions worldwide. The GFBS dataset is freely accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10037629 (He et al., 2023).},

	abstract = {Spaceborne lidar provides a unique opportunity to supplement the field plot measurements of national forest inventories (NFIs) by providing dense measurements of vertical canopy structure. For full waveform instruments such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), measurements take the form of reflected energy as a function of height within an observed footprint. Many forest attributes cannot be directly computed from the waveforms, and thus statistical models relating the measurements to target attributes must be trained using field plot data. Because the discrete footprint samples produced by spaceborne lidar instruments have little chance of collocation with pre-existing field plots, model calibration remains a primary challenge. We leveraged the density and spatial correlation of GEDI observations to make predictions of the cumulative waveform over 326,787 NFI plots distributed across the contiguous United States. The predictions yield probability distributions, giving not only a predicted waveform but quantification of prediction uncertainty. The product of this work is a data set comprised of the NFI plots paired with the predictive waveform distributions. The predicted waveforms and their uncertainties can be used to train models with “error-in-variables” techniques that account for and filter the uncertainty in the predicted waveforms. This data set and the corresponding techniques allow statistically rigorous model training without requirements of collocation, yielding downstream forest attribute predictions that are consistent with NFI measurements and estimates. We demonstrate the data set by training a model for forest above ground biomass density (AGBD) and then use the model to produce a spatially complete 1 km map of AGBD for the contiguous United States. We further compare our AGBD predictions to US NFI estimates at a 64,000 hectare scale, showing the increase in precision to be proportional to the collection of almost 500,000 additional NFI plots across forested regions of CONUS.},

	abstract = {Fire severity is closely linked to ecosystem responses. As climate change increases the frequency of severe fires, large-scale fire severity monitoring has become increasingly important. The traditional bitemporal approach, which compares single pre- and post-fire images to map fire severity, is effective at local scales but less efficient for larger-scale assessments. Recent advances in compositing multiple images have improved large-scale mapping; however, the effects of compositing parameters on mapping accuracy remain poorly understood. This study evaluates the impact of compositing parameters on composite-based fire severity maps derived from Landsat images across summer fires at multiple scales. At the large scale, we analysed fires in the Iberian Peninsula (2000−2023); at the medium scale, fires in a Mediterranean region of Spain (1985–2015), validated with national statistics; and at the local scale, two fires with field-based severity data. Various compositing parameters were tested, including the period for selecting pre- and post-fire images: lag timing (initial vs. extended assessment), seasonal timing (summer-summer, spring-summer, and summer-autumn), and the criteria for determining pre- and post-fire pixel values (mean-mean, max-min, and mean-min). Accuracy was assessed using the optimality index, correlation with the bitemporal approach, and alignment with field-based severity data, depending on the scale. Both the compositing period and criteria significantly influenced the accuracy of severity maps. In Mediterranean landscapes, the highest accuracy was achieved using post-fire imagery from the same year as the fire, whereas in alpine areas, it was achieved using post-fire imagery from the year after the fire. Seasonally consistent pre- and post-fire images acquired during summer also improved accuracy. The optimal compositing criteria varied depending on the lag timing: mean-min and max-min were most effective for assessing fire severity shortly after the fire, whereas mean-mean performed better for assessments conducted one year later. This study highlights the importance of carefully selecting compositing parameters based on the ecological characteristics of the study area. Additionally, it presents a scalable, automated methodology for large-scale fire severity mapping using Google Earth Engine, which can be applied to larger regions with appropriate adjustments to the compositing parameters.},

NASA's current GEDI and ICESat-2 missions as well as the upcoming NISAR mission will collect synergistic data with different coverage and sensitivity to AGB. In this study, we present a multi-sensor data fusion approach leveraging the strength of each mission to produce wall-to-wall AGB maps that are more accurate and spatially comprehensive than what is achievable with any one sensor alone. Specifically, we calibrate a regional L-band radar AGB model using the sparse, simulated spaceborne lidar AGB estimates. We assess our data fusion framework using simulations of GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and UAVSAR data acquired over the temperate high AGB forest and complex terrain in Sonoma County, California, USA. For ICESat-2 and GEDI missions, we simulate two years of data coverage and AGB at footprint level are estimated using realistic AGB models. We compare the performance of our fusion framework when different combinations of the sparse simulated GEDI and ICEsat-2 AGB estimates are used to calibrate our regional L-band AGB models. In addition, we test our framework at Sonoma using (a) 1-ha square grid cells and (b) similarly sized irregularly shaped objects. We demonstrate that the estimated mean AGB across Sonoma is more accurately estimated using our fusion framework than using GEDI or ICESat-2 mission data alone, either with a regular grid or with irregular segments as mapping units. This research highlights methodological opportunities for fusing new and upcoming active remote sensing data streams toward improved AGB mapping through data fusion.},

This study investigates the relationship between LULCC and wildfires. We developed a methodology based on different indicators, which allowed us to quantitatively assess and better understand the transitions between LULC classes and burnt area (BA) in Europe in the last two decades (2000–2019). The assessment was performed for the entire European continent and, independently, for each of the five European countries most affected by wildfires: Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece. The main results are the following: (i) LULCC analysis revealed a net loss in forests and arable land and a net gain in shrubs; (ii) most of the BA occurred in forests (42\% for the whole of Europe), especially in coniferous forests; (iii) transitions from BA generally were to transitional woodland/shrub or, again, to BA. Overall, our results confirm the existence of a strong relationship between wildfires and LULCCs in Europe, which was quantified in the present study. These findings are of paramount importance in fire and environmental system management and ecology.},

The study integrates hotspot data from MODIS and ESRI Global Land Cover to identify fire occurrence patterns and assess the resulting land use changes. Peak fire activity occurred in 2019, with 6,773 hotspots recorded, leading to significant land degradation. By 2023, 45.76\% of peatlands had been converted to cultivated land, primarily for agricultural purposes, while forest cover declined by 46.85\%. Cropland expanded by 2,010.25 km2, and urbanization showed gradual growth, with built-up areas increasing. Additionally, geospatial analysis was conducted to examine the impact of fires on land use and land cover changes around the 2018-2023 hotspot buffer areas. The results indicate that approximately 84.20\% of the buffer area experienced no land use change, with forests, agricultural land, and open areas remaining stable. However, 8.63\% of the area underwent deforestation, as forest land was converted to agricultural use, contributing to a 4.01\% increase in cultivated land, primarily from forests or open areas. Urbanization affected a small fraction of the area (0.07\%), while 1.39\% experienced land degradation, characterized by vegetation loss and declining soil quality. Additionally, around 1.70\% of the area showed signs of recovery through natural or human-assisted reforestation efforts. This research highlights the critical necessity for comprehensive fire prevention strategies, sustainable land management practices, and restoration initiatives to address the environmental degradation of peatland ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Fire, as a strong disturbance type, can exert significant impacts on the biosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere and human society. It can inherently trigger both critical transitions in ecosystems and dramatic changes in land cover. However, the general patterns and possible influencing factors of post-fire land cover change remain largely unclear at a global scale. Obtaining such knowledge is of great value in advancing the understanding of fire ecology and promoting sustainable fire management. Here, we combined satellite observations of long-term ESA CCI land cover (300 m resolution) and burned area data from MODIS collection 6 (500 m resolution) to assess the global post-fire land cover change patterns from 2005 to 2015. The results showed that areas with identified post-fire land cover change accounted for approximately 0.36–0.74\% of the annual global burned areas during the study period and were most common in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and the D.R. Congo. The most common land cover change types in 2005, 2010 and 2015 were “forest-to-agriculture” (31.93\%), “forest-to-shrubland” (26.23\%) and “agriculture-to-forest” (18.74\%), respectively. In addition, the conversion between agriculture and forest, and shrubland and forest, after fire were found to be bidirectional. After assessing 14 fire-related, climatic, topographic, ecological and socioeconomic factors that could potentially influence post-fire land cover change occurrence, burned area size and vegetation cover diversity were identified as the two strongest predictors, followed by aspect, fire intensity and slope. Our results provide a global overview of post-fire land cover change patterns and offer guidance for developing sustainable fire management policies.},

	abstract = {The spatially continuous mapping of vegetation structure parameters in forested areas serves as a crucial foundation for research in various fields, including ecosystem ecology, climate change, hydrology, and forest management and protection. However, there is a notable scarcity of regional scale data regarding vegetation structure parameters. Therefore, our objective was to fill this data gap by providing a methodology for mapping vegetation structure parameters in forested areas at regional-scale. Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provides precise observational data on vegetation structure parameters across the world. Using GEDI vegetation structure parameter point data, we developed a vegetation state coefficient based on the ratio of plant area index (PAI) and vegetation coverage (COVER). Subsequently, we proposed a method for decomposing vegetation coverage to simulate layered vegetation coverage. Taking Jiangxi Province as a case study, we integrated machine learning models to generate a spatially continuous map of vegetation structure parameters in forested areas, including layered coverage and layered leaf area index, in 2020. The map has a spatial resolution of 30 m and a vertical resolution of 5 m. The model exhibits excellent performance. Among the 140 sets of models, approximately 63 \% of them achieved an R2 surpassing 0.6, while 89 \% of the models achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) below 0.3. This study can serve as a valuable reference for the decomposition of vegetation structure parameters at the regional scale and provide a more precise depiction of the spatial characteristics of vertical vegetation structure at the regional scale. It contributes by providing data support and methodological guidance for research related to forest structure analysis, resource management, and ecological process simulation at the regional scale.},

	abstract = {Models of atmospheric composition rely on fire emissions inventories to reconstruct and project impacts of biomass burning on air quality, public health, climate, ecosystem dynamics, and land-atmosphere exchanges. Many such global inventories use satellite measurements of active fires and/or burned area from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, differences across inventories in the interpretation of satellite imagery, the emissions factors assumed for different components of smoke, and the adjustments made for small and obscured fires can result in large regional differences in fire emissions estimates across inventories. Using Google Earth Engine, we leverage 15 years (2003–2017) of MODIS observations and 6 years (2012–2017) of observations from the higher spatial resolution Visible Imaging Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor to develop metrics to quantify five major sources of spatial bias or uncertainty in the inventories: (1) primary reliance on active fires versus burned area, (2) cloud/haze burden on the ability of satellites to “see” fires, (3) fragmentation of burned area, (4) roughness in topography, and (5) small fires, which are challenging to detect. Based on all these uncertainties, we devise comprehensive “relative fire confidence scores,” mapped globally at 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution over 2003–2017. We then focus on fire activity in Indonesia as a case study to analyze how the choice of a fire emissions inventory affects model estimates of smoke-induced health impacts across Equatorial Asia. We use the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and apply emissions of particulate organic carbon and black carbon (OC + BC smoke) from five global inventories: Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv4s), Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINNv1.5), Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASv1.2), Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFEDv2.5r1), and Fire Energetics and Emissions Research (FEERv1.0-G1.2). We find that modeled monthly smoke PM2.5 in Singapore from 2003 to 2016 correlates with observed smoke PM2.5, with r ranging from 0.64–0.84 depending on the inventory. However, during the burning season (July to October) of high fire intensity years (e.g., 2006 and 2015), the magnitude of mean Jul-Oct modeled smoke PM2.5 can differ across inventories by {\textgreater}20 μg m−3 ({\textgreater}500\%). Using the relative fire confidence metrics, we deduce that uncertainties in this region arise primarily from the small, fragmented fire landscape and very poor satellite observing conditions due to clouds and thick haze at this time of year. Indeed, we find that modeled smoke PM2.5 using GFASv1.2, which adjusts for fires obscured by clouds and thick haze and accounts for peatland emissions, is most consistent with observations in Singapore, as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia. Finally, we develop an online app called FIRECAM for end-users of global fire emissions inventories. The app diagnoses differences in emissions among the five inventories and gauges the relative uncertainty associated with satellite-observed fires on a regional basis.},

	abstract = {Monitoring surface vegetation is essential for environmental protection, disaster prevention, and carbon sequestration in forests. However, optical remote-sensing methods and their derivative technologies typically fail to fully meet this requirement due to constraints such as lighting and weather. Radar vegetation indices (RVIs), developed based on microwave remote-sensing data, describe the dielectric properties and morphological structure of vegetation and have been applied for vegetation monitoring at various scales. This technical review is the first to systematically summarize RVIs; it analyzes and discusses their principles, developments, categories and applications, and provides a comprehensive guide for their use. Additionally, the challenges faced by RVIs, as well as their applicability, were analyzed, and future improvements and development trends were carefully projected. The selection of RVIs must consider the type of data used, the terrain and location of the study area, and the major vegetation types. The effectiveness of RVIs applied to vegetation monitoring can be affected by various factors, including index performance, sensor type, study area, and data type and quality. These factors reduce the reliability and robustness of results, as well as guide the improvement direction of RVIs. The development of technologies, such as artificial intelligence, in remote sensing offers new possibilities for RVIs, enabling the removal of background scattering, improvement in interpretation accuracy, and reduction in application thresholds. Additionally, the development trends in high resolution, multi-polarization, multi-base, multi-dimensional, and networked synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and their satellite platforms offer data support for the next generation of RVIs. The rapid development of RVIs strongly supports the use of surface vegetation monitoring and terrestrial ecosystem research.},

The comparison relies on the unique UAVSAR Jet propulsion Laboratory (JPL)/NASA L-band data, P-band data acquired by ONERA airborne system (SETHI), Small Footprint LiDAR (SFL), and NASA Land, Vegetation and Ice Sensor (LVIS) LiDAR datasets acquired in 2015 and 2016 in the frame of the AfriSAR campaign. Prior to multi-baseline data processing, a phase residual correction methodology based on phase calibration via phase center double localization has been implemented to improve the phase measurements and compensate for the phase perturbations, and disturbances originated from uncertainties in allocating flight trajectories. First, the vertical structure was estimated from L- and P-band corrected Tomography SAR data measurements, then compared with the canopy height model from SFL data. After that, the SAR and LiDAR three-dimensional (3D) datasets are compared and discussed at a qualitative basis at the region of interest. The L- and P-band’s performance for canopy penetration was assessed to determine the underlying ground locations. Additionally, the 3D records for each configuration were compared with their ability to derive forest vertical structure. Finally, the vertical structure extracted from the 3D radar reflectivity from L- and P-band are compared with SFL data, resulting in a root mean square error of 3.02 m and 3.68 m, where the coefficient of determination shows a value of 0.95 and 0.93 for P- and L-band, respectively. The results demonstrate that TomoSAR holds promise for a scientific basis in forest management activities.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2401.01848},
	abstract = {The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a spaceborne lidar instrument that collects near-global measurements of forest structure. While expansive in scope, GEDI samples are spatially sparse and cover a small fraction of the land surface. Converting the sparse samples into spatially complete predictive maps is of practical importance for many ecological studies. A complicating factor is that GEDI collects measurements over forested and non-forested land alike, with no automatic labeling of the land type. Such classification is important, as it categorically influences the probability distribution of the spatial process and the ecological interpretation of the observations/predictions. We implement a spatial mixture model, separating the spatial domain into two latent classes. The latent classes are governed by a Bernoulli spatial process and within each class the process is governed by a separate spatial model. Model predictions take the form of scalar predictions as well as discrete labeling of the class membership. Inference is conducted through a Bayesian paradigm, yielding rich quantification of prediction and uncertainty. We demonstrate the method using GEDI data over Wollemi National Park. When compared to a single spatial model, the mixture model achieves much higher posterior predictive densities on the true value. When compared to a random forest model, a common algorithmic approach in the remote sensing community, the random forest achieves better absolute prediction accuracy for prediction locations far from observed training data locations, but at the expense of location-specific assessments of uncertainty. The unsupervised binary classifications of the mixture model appear broadly ecologically interpretable as forest and non-forest when compared to optical imagery, but further comparison to ground-truth data is required.},

	abstract = {The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission can significantly enhance multisource national forest inventories (MSNFI) by improving the spatio-temporal resolution of forest attributes while preserving the statistical relevance of the design-based inference approach. The main challenge is the lack of systematic spatial alignment between GEDI footprints and National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots, which is necessary to accurately link in situ forest measurements with GEDI data. In this study, we aim to tackle the aforementioned issue by introducing a methodology for interpolating GEDI measurements to NFI plots, enabling the calibration of GEDI data using localized NFI estimates. Our proposed method incorporates clustering, classification, and regression techniques, and utilizes GEDI and NFI data, along with Sentinel-2 images, land-use information, and topographic data. Beginning with the prediction of profile structural classes and shapes on NFI plots, the proposed method ultimately projects actual measurements onto the NFI plot sites through profile pairing within the predicted structural classes. The method is conceived and validated using the data acquired across the mountainous area of {\textbackslash}sim 500 kha, covered by {\textgreater}500 NFI plots. Our validation framework shows that the method is able to project relative height profiles at NFI plots, allowing to partly interpolate the lower part of the profile and not only the canopy top height. This enables the construction of models that efficiently relate GEDI profiles and wood volume, demonstrating the importance of incorporating lower relative height values when linking forest attributes and lidar measurements (R{\textasciicircum}2=0.65, MBE=2.31 m$^{\textrm{3}}$/ha).},

Here we utilize the satellite-based “active fire” product, from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors, to statistically analyze variability and trends in fire activity from the global to regional scales. We split up the regions by economic development, region/geographical land use, clusters of fire-abundant areas, or by religious/cultural influence. Weekly cycle tests are conducted to highlight and quantify part of the anthropogenic influence on fire regime across the world. We find that there is a strong statistically significant decline in 2001–2016 active fires globally linked to an increase in net primary productivity observed in northern Africa, along with global agricultural expansion and intensification, which generally reduces fire activity. There are high levels of variability, however. The large-scale regions exhibit either little change or decreasing in fire activity except for strong increasing trends in India and China, where rapid population increase is occurring, leading to agricultural intensification and increased crop residue burning. Variability in Canada has been linked to a warming global climate leading to a longer growing season and higher fuel loads. Areas with a strong weekly cycle give a good indication of where fire management is being applied most extensively, for example, the United States, where few areas retain a natural fire regime.},

These data do not provide information like fire size, fire spread speed, how fires may evolve and joint into single event, or the number of fire events for a given area. This high level of abstraction is very valuable; it makes it possible to characterize fires by types (either size, spread, behaviour, etc.).

The mission's primary objectives will be to study Earth land and ice deformation, and ecosystems, in areas of common interest to the US and Indian science communities. This single spacecraft solution with an L-band (24 cm wavelength) and S-band (10 cm wavelength) radar has a swath of over 240 km at fine resolution, using full polarimetry where needed, uses a reflector-feed system whereby the feed aperture elements are individually sampled to allow a scan-on-receive (“SweepSAR”) capability at both L-band and S-band. This design is in contrast to recent concepts towards large constellations of smaller radar satellites, and is driven by the science requirements for complete coverage over the 12-day repeat cycle, using repeat pass interferometry and polarimetry to measure deformation and surface properties. A single spacecraft with enough aperture, power, duty cycle, and downlink capacity was determined to be a more practical and implementable solution that multiple smaller spacecraft. The use of a single large aperture reflector for both the L- and S-band radars enables both to have comparable performance, leading to overall development and operational efficiencies.},

	abstract = {The European Space Agency (ESA) released a Call for Proposals for the next Earth Explorer Core Mission in March 2005, with the aim to select the 7th Earth Explorer (EE-7) mission for launch in the next decade. Twenty-four proposals were received and subject to scientific and technical assessment. Six candidate missions were selected and further investigated in the preliminary feasibility studies (Phase 0). One of these missions is BIOMASS, which has recently been selected to proceed to Phase-A. BIOMASS is a response to the urgent need for greatly improved mapping of global biomass and the lack of any current space systems capable of addressing this need.},

	abstract = {Fire is a ubiquitous component of the Earth system that is poorly understood. To date, a global-scale understanding of fire is largely limited to the annual extent of burning as detected by satellites. This is problematic because fire is multidimensional, and focus on a single metric belies its complexity and importance within the Earth system. To address this, we identified five key characteristics of fire regimes—size, frequency, intensity, season, and extent—and combined new and existing global datasets to represent each. We assessed how these global fire regime characteristics are related to patterns of climate, vegetation (biomes), and human activity. Cross-correlations demonstrate that only certain combinations of fire characteristics are possible, reflecting fundamental constraints in the types of fire regimes that can exist. A Bayesian clustering algorithm identified five global syndromes of fire regimes, or pyromes. Four pyromes represent distinctions between crown, litter, and grass-fueled fires, and the relationship of these to biomes and climate are not deterministic. Pyromes were partially discriminated on the basis of available moisture and rainfall seasonality. Human impacts also affected pyromes and are globally apparent as the driver of a fifth and unique pyrome that represents human-engineered modifications to fire characteristics. Differing biomes and climates may be represented within the same pyrome, implying that pathways of change in future fire regimes in response to changes in climate and human activity may be difficult to predict.},

	abstract = {The GEDI instrument consists of 3 lasers producing a total of 8 beam ground transects that are spaced approximately 600 m apart on the Earth’s surface in the cross-track direction. Each beam transect consists of {\textasciitilde}30 m footprint samples approximately spaced every 60 m along track. The “coverage” laser is split into two transects that are then each dithered producing four ground transects. The other two lasers are dithered only, producing two ground transects each. The fundamental footprint observations made by the GEDI instrument are received waveforms of energy (number of photons) as a function of receive time. By accounting for the speed of light, the GEDI waveforms are a distance measure of the vertical intercepted surfaces within a footprint. Captured within the receive footprint waveforms are the range to the ground and to various metrics of vegetation or “tree” height. The GEDI instrument precisely measures the time from transmit pulse of energy to any point within the receive waveform, and therefore, measures the round-trip time of the photons. Ranging points within the waveform that represent the lowest and highest points are computed in the L1A and L1B waveform processing. These ranging points are then geolocated, and therefore by simple interpolation, the geolocation for any other ranging point within the waveform can be easily computed for the higher level L2 products. The geolocation of the ranging points within each waveform is then provided in the geolocation group along with the geophysical corrections group for the Level 1 and Level 2 GEDI products.},

	abstract = {Filtering approaches on Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) data differ considerably across existing studies and it is yet unclear which method is the most effective. We conducted an in-depth analysis of GEDI's vertical accuracy in mapping terrain and canopy heights across three study sites in temperate forests and grasslands in Spain, California, and New Zealand. We started with unfiltered data (2,081,108 footprints) and describe a workflow for data filtering using Level 2A parameters and for geolocation error mitigation. We found that retaining observations with at least one detected mode eliminates noise more effectively than sensitivity. The accuracy of terrain and canopy height observations depended considerably on the number of modes, beam sensitivity, landcover, and terrain slope. In dense forests, a minimum sensitivity of 0.9 was required, while in areas with sparse vegetation, sensitivity of 0.5 sufficed. Sensitivity greater than 0.9 resulted in an overestimation of canopy height in grasslands, especially on steep slopes, where high sensitivity led to the detection of multiple modes. We suggest excluding observations with more than five modes in grasslands. We found that the most effective strategy for filtering low-quality observations was to combine the quality flag and difference from TanDEM-X, striking an optimal balance between eliminating poor-quality data and preserving a maximum number of high-quality observations. Positional shifts improved the accuracy of GEDI terrain estimates but not of vegetation height estimates. Our findings guide users to an easy way of processing of GEDI footprints, enabling the use of the most accurate data and leading to more reliable applications.},

	abstract = {NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a spaceborne lidar mission which will produce near global (51.6°S to 51.6°N) maps of forest structure and above-ground biomass density during its 2-year mission. GEDI uses a waveform simulator for calibration of algorithms and assessing mission accuracy. This paper implements a waveform simulator, using the method proposed in Blair and Hofton (1999; https://doi.org/10.1029/1999GL010484), and builds upon that work by adding instrument noise and by validating simulated waveforms across a range of forest types, airborne laser scanning (ALS) instruments, and survey configurations. The simulator was validated by comparing waveform metrics derived from simulated waveforms against those derived from observed large-footprint, full-waveform lidar data from NASA's airborne Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS). The simulator was found to produce waveform metrics with a mean bias of less than 0.22 m and a root-mean-square error of less than 5.7 m, as long as the ALS data had sufficient pulse density. The minimum pulse density required depended upon the instrument. Measurement errors due to instrument noise predicted by the simulator were within 1.5 m of those from observed waveforms and 70–85\% of variance in measurement error was explained. Changing the ALS survey configuration had no significant impact on simulated metrics, suggesting that the ALS pulse density is a sufficient metric of simulator accuracy across the range of conditions and instruments tested. These results give confidence in the use of the simulator for the pre-launch calibration and performance assessment of the GEDI mission.},

	abstract = {The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR data have been widely used to measure tree canopy heights. However, due to the altered GEDI waveform geometry in the fire-consumed canopy layers, it is challenging to accurately detect diminished signals with the original GEDI threshold settings, which may lead to underestimation of canopy height under extreme fire conditions. In this study, we delve into the relationship between the accuracy of post-fire GEDI canopy height and front thresholds applied to GEDI waveforms. Notably, thresholds 3σ and 6σ from the GEDI settings proved too high to detect burnt canopy signals, resulting in the lowest accuracy and substantial underestimation. In contrast, the 1σ threshold achieved the highest accuracy. Subsequently, a 1D CNN model was developed to calibrate post-fire GEDI canopy height, utilizing L1B waveforms as input, resulting in a significant reduction of RMSE from 12.2 m to 6.7 m and the elimination of canopy height underestimation in high and extreme fire severity scenarios. In the third experiment, a 2D CNN model was constructed for mapping calibrated canopy height with Sentinel-2 images, revealing a noteworthy drop in RMSE from 14.6 m to 8.5 m compared to the same model using original GEDI canopy height.},

However, research on geographic elevation inversion with multi-band spaceborne lidars is limited, especially in developing algorithms that fully utilize multiple wavelengths for accurate measurements. A high-precision multiband fusion algorithm (MBFA) is proposed for global geographic elevation inversion for multiband spaceborne lidar of China's Daqi-1 satellite (DQ-1), enhancing the ranging capability of the 1572 nm channel by approximately 5 times. Compared with ICESat-2, GEDI and airborne scanning data in Finland, the geographic elevation results of MBFA showed average biases of –0.09, 0.1, and –0.95 m, with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 3.68, 4.51, and 7.70 m, respectively. Accurate forest canopy heights can be obtained using the decomposed signal approach in MBFA, which has been verified in Finland. The validation results (R2 = 0.72, RMSE = 1.38 m, BIAS = –0.75 m) demonstrate the DQ-1 satellite's effectiveness in measuring canopy height. The results indicate that the MBFA model has potential for global forest canopy height extraction and carbon sink research. The proposed MBFA can also provide guide for high-precision inversion of future multiband lidar satellites.},

In this paper we comprehensively introduce and compare the classification and quantification methods for fire severity; we discuss the development and application status of various methods, and we elucidate their existing problems. Results: 1) According to features of the burned area, fire severity can be classified as light, moderate, and heavy. 2) Using composite burn index (CBI) to quantify and record the fire severity. 3) In quantifying fire severity with vegetation change, there are certain limitations and theoretical problems to be solved. 4) Remote sensing could very well be an important means of measuring fire severity in the future, but there are still many problems that need to be solved before the remote sensing index can become a global fire severity indicator. Discussion and Conclusion: Only by clarifying the relationship between fire behavior, fire severity, time related variables and the pre- and post-fire ecosystem can the existing models be perfected or new, better fire severity measurement models be proposed for broad applications.},

	abstract = {Several recent papers have suggested replacing the terminology of fire intensity and fire severity. Part of the problem with fire intensity is that it is sometimes used incorrectly to describe fire effects, when in fact it is justifiably restricted to measures of energy output. Increasingly, the term has created confusion because some authors have restricted its usage to a single measure of energy output referred to as fireline intensity. This metric is most useful in understanding fire behavior in forests, but is too narrow to fully capture the multitude of ways fire energy affects ecosystems. Fire intensity represents the energy released during various phases of a fire, and different metrics such as reaction intensity, fireline intensity, temperature, heating duration and radiant energy are useful for different purposes. Fire severity, and the related term burn severity, have created considerable confusion because of recent changes in their usage. Some authors have justified this by contending that fire severity is defined broadly as ecosystem impacts from fire and thus is open to individual interpretation. However, empirical studies have defined fire severity operationally as the loss of or change in organic matter aboveground and belowground, although the precise metric varies with management needs. Confusion arises because fire or burn severity is sometimes defined so that it also includes ecosystem responses. Ecosystem responses include soil erosion, vegetation regeneration, restoration of community structure, faunal recolonization, and a plethora of related response variables. Although some ecosystem responses are correlated with measures of fire or burn severity, many important ecosystem processes have either not been demonstrated to be predicted by severity indices or have been shown in some vegetation types to be unrelated to severity. This is a critical issue because fire or burn severity are readily measurable parameters, both on the ground and with remote sensing, yet ecosystem responses are of most interest to resource managers.},

	abstract = {Human and natural forces are rapidly modifying the global distribution and structure of terrestrial ecosystems on which all of life depends, altering the global carbon cycle, affecting our climate now and for the foreseeable future, causing steep reductions in species diversity, and endangering Earth's sustainability. To understand changes and trends in terrestrial ecosystems and their functioning as carbon sources and sinks, and to characterize the impact of their changes on climate, habitat and biodiversity, new space assets are urgently needed to produce high spatial resolution global maps of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of vegetation, its biomass above ground, the carbon stored within and the implications for atmospheric green house gas concentrations and climate. These needs were articulated in a 2007 National Research Council (NRC) report (NRC, 2007) recommending a new satellite mission, DESDynI, carrying an L-band Polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (Pol-SAR) and a multi-beam lidar (Light RAnging And Detection) operating at 1064nm. The objectives of this paper are to articulate the importance of these new, multi-year, 3D vegetation structure and biomass measurements, to briefly review the feasibility of radar and lidar remote sensing technology to meet these requirements, to define the data products and measurement requirements, and to consider implications of mission durations. The paper addresses these objectives by synthesizing research results and other input from a broad community of terrestrial ecology, carbon cycle, and remote sensing scientists and working groups. We conclude that:(1)Current global biomass and 3-D vegetation structure information is unsuitable for both science and management and policy. The only existing global datasets of biomass are approximations based on combining land cover type and representative carbon values, instead of measurements of actual biomass. Current measurement attempts based on radar and multispectral data have low explanatory power outside low biomass areas. There is no current capability for repeatable disturbance and regrowth estimates.(2)The science and policy needs for information on vegetation 3D structure can be successfully addressed by a mission capable of producing (i) a first global inventory of forest biomass with a spatial resolution 1km or finer and unprecedented accuracy (ii) annual global disturbance maps at a spatial resolution of 1ha with subsequent biomass accumulation rates at resolutions of 1km or finer, and (iii) transects of vertical and horizontal forest structure with 30m along-transect measurements globally at 25m spatial resolution, essential for habitat characterization. We also show from the literature that lidar profile samples together with wall-to-wall L-band quad-pol-SAR imagery and ecosystem dynamics models can work together to satisfy these vegetation 3D structure and biomass measurement requirements. Finally we argue that the technology readiness levels of combined pol-SAR and lidar instruments are adequate for space flight. Remaining to be worked out, are the particulars of a lidar/pol-SAR mission design that is feasible and at a minimum satisfies the information and measurement requirement articulated herein.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has proven to be a powerful tool for utilizing the rapidly increasing amounts of remote sensing data for environmental monitoring. Yet ML models often require a substantial amount of ground truth labels for training, and models trained using labeled data from one domain often demonstrate poor performance when directly applied to other domains. Transfer learning (TL) has emerged as a promising strategy to address domain shift and alleviate the need for labeled data. Here we provide the first systematic review of TL studies in environmental remote sensing. We start by defining the different forms of domain shift and then describe five commonly used TL techniques. We then present the results of a systematic search for peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2022, which identified 1676 papers. Applications of TL in remote sensing have increased rapidly, with nearly 10 times more publications in 2022 than in 2017. Across seven categories of applications (land cover mapping, vegetation monitoring, soil property estimation, crop yield prediction, biodiversity monitoring, water resources management, and natural disaster management) we identify several recent successes of TL as well as some remaining research gaps. Finally, we highlight the need to organize benchmark datasets explicitly for TL in remote sensing for model evaluation. We also discuss potential research directions for TL studies in environmental remote sensing, such as realizing scale transfer, improving model interpretability, and leveraging foundation models for remote sensing tasks.},

	abstract = {Fires are a major contributor to atmospheric budgets of greenhouse gases and aerosols, affect soils and vegetation properties, and are a key driver of land use change. Since the 1990s, global burned area (BA) estimates based on satellite observations have provided critical insights into patterns and trends of fire occurrence. However, these global BA products are based on coarse spatial-resolution sensors, which are unsuitable for detecting small fires that burn only a fraction of a satellite pixel. We estimated the relevance of those small fires by comparing a BA product generated from Sentinel-2 MSI (Multispectral Instrument) images (20-m spatial resolution) with a widely used global BA product based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images (500 m) focusing on sub-Saharan Africa. For the year 2016, we detected 80\% more BA with Sentinel-2 images than with the MODIS product. This difference was predominately related to small fires: we observed that 2.02 Mkm2 (out of a total of 4.89 Mkm2) was burned by fires smaller than 100 ha, whereas the MODIS product only detected 0.13 million km2 BA in that fire-size class. This increase in BA subsequently resulted in increased estimates of fire emissions; we computed 31 to 101\% more fire carbon emissions than current estimates based on MODIS products. We conclude that small fires are a critical driver of BA in sub-Saharan Africa and that including those small fires in emission estimates raises the contribution of biomass burning to global burdens of (greenhouse) gases and aerosols.},

However, EO data offers the unique opportunity to pair data from different modalities and sensors automatically based on geographic location and time, at virtually no human labor cost. We seize this opportunity to create MMEarth, a diverse multi-modal pretraining dataset at global scale. Using this new corpus of 1.2 million locations, we propose a Multi-Pretext Masked Autoencoder (MP-MAE) approach to learn general-purpose representations for optical satellite images. Our approach builds on the ConvNeXt V2 architecture, a fully convolutional masked autoencoder (MAE). Drawing upon a suite of multi-modal pretext tasks, we demonstrate that our MP-MAE approach outperforms both MAEs pretrained on ImageNet and MAEs pretrained on domain-specific satellite images. This is shown on several downstream tasks including image classification and semantic segmentation. We find that pretraining with multi-modal pretext tasks notably improves the linear probing performance compared to pretraining on optical satellite images only. This also leads to better label efficiency and parameter efficiency which are crucial aspects in global scale applications.},

	abstract = {Understanding post-fire recovery dynamics is critical for effective management that enhance forest resilience to fire. Mediterranean pine forests have been largely affected by wildfires, but the impacts of both changes in land use and climate endanger their capacity to naturally recover. Multispectral imagery is commonly used to estimate post-fire recovery, yet changes in forest structure must be considered for a comprehensive evaluation of forest recovery. In this research, we combine Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) with Landsat imagery to extrapolate forest structure variables over a 30-year period (1990–2020) to provide insights on how forest structure has recovered after fire in Mediterranean pine forests. Forest recovery was evaluated attending to vegetation cover (VC), tree cover (TC), mean height (MH) and heterogeneity (CVH). Structure variables were derived from two LiDAR acquisitions from 2016 and 2009, for calibration and independent spatial and temporal validation. A Support Vector Regression model (SVR) was calibrated to extrapolate LiDAR-derived variables using a series of Landsat imagery, achieving an R2 of 0.78, 0.64, 0.70 and 0.63, and a relative RMSE of 24.4\%, 30.2\%, 36.5\% and 27.4\% for VC, TC, MH and CVH, respectively. Models showed to be consistent in the temporal validation, although a wider variability was observed, with R2 ranging from 0.51 to 0.74. A different response to fire was revealed attending to forest cover and height since vegetation cover recovered to a pre-fire state but mean height did not 26-years after fire. Less than 50\% of the area completely recovered to the pre-fire structure within 26 years, and the area subjected to fire recurrence showed signs of greater difficulty in initiating the recovery. Our results provide valuable information on forest structure recovery, which can support the implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies that enhance fire resilience.},

An increase in fire frequency in recent years, particularly in regions traditionally not prone to fire, such as central Europe, has increased demands for large-scale remote sensing fuel information. This study develops a methodology for mapping canopy fuels over large areas (Germany) at high spatial resolution, exclusively relying on open remote sensing data. We propose a two-step approach where we first use measurements from NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) instrument to estimate canopy fuel variables at the footprint level, before predicting high-resolution raster maps. Instead of using field measurements, we generate (GEDI-) footprint-level estimates for canopy (Base) height (CH, CBH), cover (CC), bulk density (CBD), and fuel load (CFL) by segmenting airborne Light Detection and Ranging point clouds and processing tree-level metrics with allometric crown biomass models. To predict footprint-level canopy fuels we fit and tune Random Forest models, which are cross-validated using k-fold nearest neighbor distance matching. Predictions at {\textgreater}1.6 M GEDI footprints and biophysical raster covariates are combined with a universal Kriging method to produce countrywide maps at 20 m resolution. Agreement (RMSE/R2) with validation data (from the same population) was strong for footprint-level predictions and moderate for map predictions. A validation with estimates based on National Forest Inventory data revealed low to modest agreement. Better accuracy was achieved for variables related to height (CH, CBH) rather than to cover or biomass (CBD, CFL). Error analysis pointed towards a mixture of biases in model predictions and validation data, as well as underestimation of model prediction standard errors. Contributing factors may be simplification through allometric equations and spatial and temporal mismatch of data inputs. The proposed workflow has the potential to support regions where wildfire is an emerging issue, and fuel and field information is scarce or unavailable.},

	abstract = {The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR data have been widely used to measure tree canopy heights. However, due to the altered GEDI waveform geometry in the fire-consumed canopy layers, it is challenging to accurately detect diminished signals with the original GEDI threshold settings, which may lead to underestimation of canopy height under extreme fire conditions. In this study, we delve into the relationship between the accuracy of post-fire GEDI canopy height and front thresholds applied to GEDI waveforms. Notably, thresholds 3σ and 6σ from the GEDI settings proved too high to detect burnt canopy signals, resulting in the lowest accuracy and substantial underestimation. In contrast, the 1σ threshold achieved the highest accuracy. Subsequently, a 1D CNN model was developed to calibrate post-fire GEDI canopy height, utilizing L1B waveforms as input, resulting in a significant reduction of RMSE from 12.2 m to 6.7 m and the elimination of canopy height underestimation in high and extreme fire severity scenarios. In the third experiment, a 2D CNN model was constructed for mapping calibrated canopy height with Sentinel-2 images, revealing a noteworthy drop in RMSE from 14.6 m to 8.5 m compared to the same model using original GEDI canopy height.},

	abstract = {Natural and human-ignited fires affect all major biomes, altering ecosystem structure, biogeochemical cycles and atmospheric composition. Satellite observations provide global data on spatiotemporal patterns of biomass burning and evidence for the rapid changes in global fire activity in response to land management and climate. Satellite imagery also provides detailed information on the daily or sub-daily position of fires that can be used to understand the dynamics of individual fires. The Global Fire Atlas is a new global dataset that tracks the dynamics of individual fires to determine the timing and location of ignitions, fire size and duration, and daily expansion, fire line length, speed, and direction of spread. Here, we present the underlying methodology and Global Fire Atlas results for 2003–2016 derived from daily moderate-resolution (500\&thinsp;m) Collection 6 MCD64A1 burned-area data. The algorithm identified 13.3 million individual fires over the study period, and estimated fire perimeters were in good agreement with independent data for the continental United States. A small number of large fires dominated sparsely populated arid and boreal ecosystems, while burned area in agricultural and other human-dominated landscapes was driven by high ignition densities that resulted in numerous smaller fires. Long-duration fires in boreal regions and natural landscapes in the humid tropics suggest that fire season length exerts a strong control on fire size and total burned area in these areas. In arid ecosystems with low fuel densities, high fire spread rates resulted in large, short-duration fires that quickly consumed available fuels. Importantly, multiday fires contributed the majority of burned area in all biomass burning regions. A first analysis of the largest, longest and fastest fires that occurred around the world revealed coherent regional patterns of extreme fires driven by large-scale climate forcing. Global Fire Atlas data are publicly available through http://www.globalfiredata.org (last access: 9 August 2018) and https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1642, and individual fire information and summary data products provide new information for benchmarking fire models within ecosystem and Earth system models, understanding vegetation–fire feedbacks, improving global emissions estimates, and characterizing the changing role of fire in the Earth system.},

	abstract = {Forest productivity, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in California and the Western United States are closely tied to fire. However, fire regimes are shifting toward larger, more severe fires driven by factors such as high fuel loads and increased temperature and aridity. While multispectral satellite (e.g., Landsat) burn indices provide valuable insights into fire severity, they primarily capture top-of-canopy greenness, missing important sub-canopy changes in vegetation structure and residual fuels. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne lidar mission provides current and consistent, near-global 3D forest structure measurements, enabling detailed assessment of forest changes from disturbances such as wildfire. This study utilized near-coincident, bitemporal pre- and post-fire GEDI on-orbit measurements to analyze structural changes across thirty-four large California wildfires (2019 to 2021). We examined twelve GEDI-based forest structure metrics representing a variety of 3D fuels properties, including forest height, low-stature fuels, biomass, canopy heterogeneity, volume and cover. Our broad goals were to: 1) assess GEDI's ability to detect structural changes in burned areas relative to control areas; and 2) in burned areas, explore relationships between forest structural change and factors such as pre-fire fuel loads, Landsat-based differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), topographic slope, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit, evapotranspiration, and time since fire. Results showed significant structural loss in all GEDI structural metrics for burned areas relative to nearby controls. Pre-fire fuel loads measured by GEDI metrics were the strongest predictors of post-fire structural change, with linear models explaining an average of 46 \% of variance. Model slopes showed increasing levels of pre-fire fuels were associated with large, significant post-fire decreases in canopy structure – that is, more fuels lead to higher wildfire severity, particularly for conifer forests of the Klamath, Cascades and Sierra Nevada ecoregions. One metric, measuring the proportion of waveform energy below 10 m height, increased significantly after fire in mixed and conifer forests due to canopy opening, which enhanced lidar penetration toward the ground. In contrast, the widely-used dNBR burn severity index was less correlated with GEDI-based forest structural change than pre-fire fuels, particularly in sub-canopy fuels, with models explaining no more than 32 \% of the variance (average 19 \%). GEDI overcomes key limitations of airborne lidar, including high cost, limited extent, and data latency, enabling scalable and timely assessments of wildfire impacts needed to manage fuels and track forest resilience and recovery. Further, GEDI metrics are physically-based and ecologically interpretable, providing complimentary information to multispectral burn severity indices.},

	abstract = {Forests in Europe are undergoing complex changes that require a comprehensive monitoring of disturbance occurrence. Here, we present the European Forest Disturbance Atlas (EFDA), a Landsat-based approach for mapping annual forest disturbances across continental Europe from 1985 onwards. We built a consistent Landsat data cube of summer composites and compiled reference data on forest land use and forest disturbances. A classification-based approach was developed to detect forest disturbances annually, therefore accounting for multiple disturbance events per time series. The EFDA contains annual layers on disturbance occurrence, severity, and agent, as well as aggregated layers on the number of disturbances and the latest and greatest disturbance year. Based on the annual disturbance estimates (1985–2023), we quantified a total forest disturbed area of 439 000 km2, which increases to 610 000 km2 when accounting for multiple overlapping disturbance events. Map accuracies of the disturbance classification showed an overall F1 score of 0.89, with very low errors (\&lt;1 \%) for the undisturbed class and with commission and omission errors for the disturbed class of 17.3 \% and 22.5 \%, respectively. Further, temporal validation revealed that errors decreased over time, with commission errors decreasing substantially to 10.6 \% after the year 2000. We designed and implemented our workflow to create annual forest disturbance maps for easy updating when new data arrive and in an open-access framework to facilitate reproducibility, thus paving the road for an operational forest disturbance system in Europe.

The following chapters contain some literature that could be (or not) interesting for the reader. They are mainly related to topics focusing on the **Integration of spaceborne LiDAR data and multi-frequency Earth Observation data for assessing fire-induced vegetation structure changes**, which is my PhD research topic. 

The general objective of my research is to: ***Tto assess fire-induced vegetation structure changes across multiple scales by integrating multi-frequency satellite data and spaceborne LiDAR data***. For it, I intend to focus on 3 specific objectives:

  <a href="sections/first_chapter.qmd" class="btn" style="background-color: #DAA520; color: white; padding: 2px; border-radius: 10px;" role="button"> Objective 1: Facilitate the analysis of vegetation structure change using spaceborne LiDAR by developing a framework to acquire spaceborne LiDAR measurements that are consistent in both spatial and feature-space domains 🌳  </a>

  <a href="sections/second_chapter.qmd" class="btn" style="background-color: #337AB7; color: white; padding: 2px; border-radius: 10px;" role="button"> Objective 2: Spatially characterize the impacts of fires on the vegetation structure of two different fire-prone regions (Australia & Spain) by integrating the spaceborne LiDAR measurements and multi-frequency satellite datasets  🛰️+🛰️ </a>

  <a href="sections/third_chapter.qmd" class="btn" style="background-color: #FF5733; color: white; padding: 2px; border-radius: 10px;" role="button"> Objective 3:	Quantify and explain the global dynamics of fire-induced vegetation structure changes by developing global models with a specific focus on geographic generalization  🔥 </a>

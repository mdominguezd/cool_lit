The following chapters contain some literature that could be (or not) interesting for the reader. They are mainly related to topics focusing on the **Integration of spaceborne LiDAR data and multi-frequency Earth Observation data for assessing fire-induced vegetation structure changes**, which is my PhD research topic. The general objective of my research is to: ***To develop a systematic approach for leveraging spaceborne LiDAR data to assess fire-induced vegetation structure changes, with a particular focus on improving measurement comparability, integrating Earth observation datasets, and evaluating the scalability of this integration across different spatial scales.*** For it, I intend to foucs on 4 objectives:

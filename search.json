    "text": "Remote sensing for wildfire monitoring: Insights into burned area, emissions, and fire dynamics (2024)\n\nMain takeaways for me\n\nDivided the paper into RS for BA, FE and AF.\nThermal imagers, which detect the infrared radiation emitted by fires, are the primary tools for real-time monitoring of AFs. Burning vegetation at temperatures between 500°C and 1,200°C emits significantly more infrared radiation than its surroundings.\nThe Global Fire Emissions Database BA (GFED BA) combines information from multiple satellite platforms to obtain better BA datasets, using the MODIS MCD64 BA product as its primary input. AF data from the ATSR and VIRS sensors are used to extend the data record prior to the MODIS era.\n\n\nMethods for using remotely sensed data to estimate fire emissions.\n\nThe formula for estimating gas and aerosol species emitted from fires (E) follows several sequential steps: Ei = A × B × C × EFi, where A is the area burned; B is the biomass available per area; C is combustion completeness, representing the fraction of biomass actually consumed; and EFi is the emission factor for species i. (This approach has produced most of the current fire emissions datasets, including GFED, FLAMBE, GICC, WFEIS, MFLEI, and FINN) (Bottom-up approach)\nPhysically based on the linear correlation between remotely sensed fire radiative energy and biomass consumed in fires, independent of vegetation type. (Top-down approach)\nSatellite instruments measure atmospheric concentrations of fire-emitted pollutants (CO, NOx, CO2) and integrate these with atmospheric inversion.\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nAF detections often suffer from false alarms due to bright surfaces reflecting sunlight that cannot be completely screened out using available image bands.\nBA algorithms can misinterpret land-use changes as fire activity\nSmall, cool, understory, and sub-surface fires are frequently omitted.\nBIG DOMAIN ADAPTATION POTENTIAL: Data integration poses additional challenges. Developing algorithms that perform well globally is difficult due to regional differences in vegetation, fire behavior, and climate.\n\n\n\n\nRS workflow for fire monitoring\n\n\n\nTaken from: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332224002574"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The spatial coverage limitation and the lack of guaranteed repeated cycle of GEDI makes structural change analysis particularly difficult.\n\n\n\nHypothesis: If wall-to-wall products (SAR + MSI) can explain the spatial variation of vegetation structural changes detected by GEDI; a model, in which comparable GEDI pairs are used as training data and other EO products as covariates, could be used to upscale the structural changes for a specific study area.\n\n\nProposed outcome: A spatially continuous characterization of fire-induced forest structural changes in a European region that is prone to forest fires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the current methods for integrating LiDAR and other EO data to assess vegetation structure? (Normally not structure change, or change at all).\nHow have previous studies quantify vegetation structural changes in fire-affected areas, and what are the main limitations?\nWhat machine learning or statistical models have been applied for upscaling vegetation structural metrics from LiDAR data to broader spatial scales using optical and radar data?\nWhat are the future directions for GEDI + EO data integration research?\nHow is the integration of GEDI and EO data validated and the uncertainty calculated?\n\n\n\n\nSince the launch of the GEDI mission, multiple studies have been developed on the integration of this data with other EO products to obtain regional and/or global spatial charaterization of the structural variables measured by GEDI. Most of these studies have focused on mono-temporal integration of EO products. In other words, the use of single GEDI measurements combined with other EO products to obtain regional or global maps with modeled vegetation structure variables. However, the integration of Bi-Temporal LiDAR data and EO products to assess change on these variables still needs to be studied further.\n\n\nMost of the studies integrating GEDI with other EO data products have focused on the estimation of variables like canopy height and above ground biomass density (AGBD).\nPotapov et al. (2021) created a global forest canopy height map for 2019, by using regression trees to extrapolate GEDI footprint-level forest canopy height measurements using multitemporal metrics derived from global Landsat analysis-ready data (CH integrating GEDI with Landsat).\nLang et al. (2023) developed a probabilistic deep learning model that fuses sparse canopy height data from the GEDI space-borne LiDAR mission with dense optical satellite images from Sentinel-2 to create a high-resolution global canopy height map.\n\n\n\nOther studies have used bi-temporal GEDI observations (real post-fire and simulated pre-fire from ALS data) at footprint locations to analyse structural vegetation fire response and then compared these responses with spectral vegetation fire responses derived from temporally corresponding Landsat pixels (Huettermann et al. 2023). On their study, they found that structural change metrics derived from bi-temporal GEDI observations generally demonstrated a more pronounced decline than spectral indices. Notably, the median fire response of RH50 declined to 8.6% of the pre-fire value.\nMoreover, Holcomb et al. (2024) related change on near-coincident GEDI pairs with change on landsat derived (disturbance intensity metrics).\n\n\n\n\nDue to the difficulty of getting near-coincident GEDI footprints, previous research has mainly worked using simulated GEDI data to evaluate the potential of GEDI to asses structural changes (Hancock et al. 2019). Nevertheless, Holcomb et al. (2024) and Besnard, Dombrowski, and Holcomb (2025) ’s work make it now possible to compare real near-coincident GEDI pairs.\nOn orbit GEDI measurements combined with simulated GEDI shots were used to evaluate structural vegetation fire response after the black summer fires in Australia (Huettermann et al. 2023). A brief description of their methods is presented on Table 1.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Methods used by Huettermann et al. (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1. Acquisition of Post-fire GEDI Data\nReal GEDI Version 2 data were collected in 2021 to assess forest structure one year after the 2019/2020 Black Summer fires. Data were filtered for quality.\n\n\n2. Simulation of Pre-fire GEDI Data\nPre-fire ALS point cloud data (captured between 2013 and 2017) were processed with the GEDI simulator using the footprint locations of the real GEDI data to emulate pre-fire structural observations .\n\n\n3. Calculation of Structural Vegetation Fire Response (StVFR)\nBi-temporal comparison was performed at the footprint level by calculating the ratio of rescaled post-fire real GEDI metrics to rescaled pre-fire simulated GEDI metrics using \\(\\frac{GEDI_{post}}{GEDI_{pre}}\\).\n\n\n4. Data Filtering and Stratification\nThe dataset was restricted to areas solely burned by the Black Summer fires based on Landsat and NSW fire records and stratified by fire severity and forest type to examine the impact of these factors on the structural response.\n\n\n5. Data Analysis\nStatistical analyses (boxplots, descriptive statistics, T-tests) were conducted to compare the fire responses of different structural metrics and to assess the influence of fire severity and forest type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious studies like East et al. (2023) only considered simulated data to assess structural changes measured by GEDI. A description of their methods is presented on Table 2.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Methods used by East et al. (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nUtilizing Existing ALS Data\nALS data from 2013, covering four sites in Acre, Brazil (Bonal, Talismã, Humaitá, Rio Branco), with ~10 points/m² resolution, collected post-fires (2005, 2010).\n\n\nSimulating GEDI Data from ALS\nALS data was processed with a GEDI simulator to create 25-m diameter footprints, mimicking GEDI L1B data.\n\n\nDeriving Canopy Height Profiles & PAI\nSimulated waveforms were processed to derive canopy height profiles (RH curve) and plant area index (PAI) for 5 m height bins, using Gaussian ground finding algorithms.\n\n\nStratified Random Sampling Design\nSimulated footprints were sampled via stratified random sampling, considering burn status and distance from forest edge (0–250 m, 250–500 m, 500–1000 m, 1000+ m).\n\n\nDefining Burned and Unburned Areas\nBurn scars were classified using MODIS and Landsat data, geo-referenced to ALS boundaries, and re-digitized for accurate spatial analysis.\n\n\nQuantifying Changes in PAI\nWilcoxon’s signed-rank test was used to compare median PAI differences between burned and unburned areas for each height bin, with 95% confidence intervals.\n\n\nAnalyzing Relative Height Curve Responses\nNegative binomial GAMs were applied to assess differences in RH curves between burned and unburned areas, modeling height return as a function of burn status and RH%.\n\n\nDeveloping a Fire Severity Metric (RHsum)\nRHsum, the sum of positive RH values (RH0–RH98), was proposed as a fire severity metric. Differences in RHsum medians were tested using Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test.\n\n\nComparing Measured Changes to On-Orbit GEDI Accuracy\nMeasured changes in PAI, RH curves, and RHsum were compared to on-orbit GEDI error metrics (R², RMSE, MAE, bias) to evaluate GEDI’s sensitivity to detect structural changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine learning (ML) techniques, such as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been extensively used to integrate GEDI and EO data. These models are trained on GEDI-derived metrics (e.g., relative heights) and predictors from EO data (e.g., vegetation indices, SAR backscatter) to predict vegetation structure attributes like canopy height and AGB.\nFor most of the cases, simple RF or other ML models (Also some including object-based modelling with stratification). (L. Chen et al. 2023)\n\n\n\nDeep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-modal attention networks, have been explored for fusing GEDI and EO data. These models are particularly effective at handling the complex interactions between multi-sensor data and extracting features that are critical for vegetation structure mapping.\nThe deep learning method used by Lang et al. (2023) is a probabilistic approach employing an ensemble of fully convolutional neural networks that fuses sparse GEDI LiDAR data with dense Sentinel-2 optical imagery, incorporating geographical context and strategies to improve the accuracy.\nM. Chen et al. (2023) proposed a novel deep learning framework called the multi-modal attention remote sensing network (MARSNet). The MARSNet architecture is based on an encoder-decoder structure. A crucial aspect is the use of separate, identical encoders for each remote sensing data modality. These modalities include Sentinel-1 C-band SAR, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, Sentinel-2 optical data, and ancillary data (NASADEM elevation and slope, latitude and longitude). This design prevents interference between different data types during feature extraction. They used dominant height derived from GEDI relative heights (RH) metrics as labels.

    "text": "What are the current methods for integrating LiDAR and other EO data to assess vegetation structure? (Normally not structure change, or change at all).\nHow have previous studies quantify vegetation structural changes in fire-affected areas, and what are the main limitations?\nWhat machine learning or statistical models have been applied for upscaling vegetation structural metrics from LiDAR data to broader spatial scales using optical and radar data?\nWhat are the future directions for GEDI + EO data integration research?\nHow is the integration of GEDI and EO data validated and the uncertainty calculated?\n\n\n\n\nSince the launch of the GEDI mission, multiple studies have been developed on the integration of this data with other EO products to obtain regional and/or global spatial charaterization of the structural variables measured by GEDI. Most of these studies have focused on mono-temporal integration of EO products. In other words, the use of single GEDI measurements combined with other EO products to obtain regional or global maps with modeled vegetation structure variables. However, the integration of Bi-Temporal LiDAR data and EO products to assess change on these variables still needs to be studied further.\n\n\nMost of the studies integrating GEDI with other EO data products have focused on the estimation of variables like canopy height and above ground biomass density (AGBD).\nPotapov et al. (2021) created a global forest canopy height map for 2019, by using regression trees to extrapolate GEDI footprint-level forest canopy height measurements using multitemporal metrics derived from global Landsat analysis-ready data (CH integrating GEDI with Landsat).\nLang et al. (2023) developed a probabilistic deep learning model that fuses sparse canopy height data from the GEDI space-borne LiDAR mission with dense optical satellite images from Sentinel-2 to create a high-resolution global canopy height map.\n\n\n\nOther studies have used bi-temporal GEDI observations (real post-fire and simulated pre-fire from ALS data) at footprint locations to analyse structural vegetation fire response and then compared these responses with spectral vegetation fire responses derived from temporally corresponding Landsat pixels (Huettermann et al. 2023). On their study, they found that structural change metrics derived from bi-temporal GEDI observations generally demonstrated a more pronounced decline than spectral indices. Notably, the median fire response of RH50 declined to 8.6% of the pre-fire value.\nMoreover, Holcomb et al. (2024) related change on near-coincident GEDI pairs with change on landsat derived (disturbance intensity metrics).\n\n\n\n\nDue to the difficulty of getting near-coincident GEDI footprints, previous research has mainly worked using simulated GEDI data to evaluate the potential of GEDI to asses structural changes (Hancock et al. 2019). Nevertheless, Holcomb et al. (2024) and Besnard, Dombrowski, and Holcomb (2025) ’s work make it now possible to compare real near-coincident GEDI pairs.\nOn orbit GEDI measurements combined with simulated GEDI shots were used to evaluate structural vegetation fire response after the black summer fires in Australia (Huettermann et al. 2023). A brief description of their methods is presented on Table 1.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Methods used by Huettermann et al. (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1. Acquisition of Post-fire GEDI Data\nReal GEDI Version 2 data were collected in 2021 to assess forest structure one year after the 2019/2020 Black Summer fires. Data were filtered for quality.\n\n\n2. Simulation of Pre-fire GEDI Data\nPre-fire ALS point cloud data (captured between 2013 and 2017) were processed with the GEDI simulator using the footprint locations of the real GEDI data to emulate pre-fire structural observations .\n\n\n3. Calculation of Structural Vegetation Fire Response (StVFR)\nBi-temporal comparison was performed at the footprint level by calculating the ratio of rescaled post-fire real GEDI metrics to rescaled pre-fire simulated GEDI metrics using \\(\\frac{GEDI_{post}}{GEDI_{pre}}\\).\n\n\n4. Data Filtering and Stratification\nThe dataset was restricted to areas solely burned by the Black Summer fires based on Landsat and NSW fire records and stratified by fire severity and forest type to examine the impact of these factors on the structural response.\n\n\n5. Data Analysis\nStatistical analyses (boxplots, descriptive statistics, T-tests) were conducted to compare the fire responses of different structural metrics and to assess the influence of fire severity and forest type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious studies like East et al. (2023) only considered simulated data to assess structural changes measured by GEDI. A description of their methods is presented on Table 2.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Methods used by East et al. (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nUtilizing Existing ALS Data\nALS data from 2013, covering four sites in Acre, Brazil (Bonal, Talismã, Humaitá, Rio Branco), with ~10 points/m² resolution, collected post-fires (2005, 2010).\n\n\nSimulating GEDI Data from ALS\nALS data was processed with a GEDI simulator to create 25-m diameter footprints, mimicking GEDI L1B data.\n\n\nDeriving Canopy Height Profiles & PAI\nSimulated waveforms were processed to derive canopy height profiles (RH curve) and plant area index (PAI) for 5 m height bins, using Gaussian ground finding algorithms.\n\n\nStratified Random Sampling Design\nSimulated footprints were sampled via stratified random sampling, considering burn status and distance from forest edge (0–250 m, 250–500 m, 500–1000 m, 1000+ m).\n\n\nDefining Burned and Unburned Areas\nBurn scars were classified using MODIS and Landsat data, geo-referenced to ALS boundaries, and re-digitized for accurate spatial analysis.\n\n\nQuantifying Changes in PAI\nWilcoxon’s signed-rank test was used to compare median PAI differences between burned and unburned areas for each height bin, with 95% confidence intervals.\n\n\nAnalyzing Relative Height Curve Responses\nNegative binomial GAMs were applied to assess differences in RH curves between burned and unburned areas, modeling height return as a function of burn status and RH%.\n\n\nDeveloping a Fire Severity Metric (RHsum)\nRHsum, the sum of positive RH values (RH0–RH98), was proposed as a fire severity metric. Differences in RHsum medians were tested using Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test.\n\n\nComparing Measured Changes to On-Orbit GEDI Accuracy\nMeasured changes in PAI, RH curves, and RHsum were compared to on-orbit GEDI error metrics (R², RMSE, MAE, bias) to evaluate GEDI’s sensitivity to detect structural changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine learning (ML) techniques, such as Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been extensively used to integrate GEDI and EO data. These models are trained on GEDI-derived metrics (e.g., relative heights) and predictors from EO data (e.g., vegetation indices, SAR backscatter) to predict vegetation structure attributes like canopy height and AGB.\nFor most of the cases, simple RF or other ML models (Also some including object-based modelling with stratification). (L. Chen et al. 2023)\n\n\n\nDeep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-modal attention networks, have been explored for fusing GEDI and EO data. These models are particularly effective at handling the complex interactions between multi-sensor data and extracting features that are critical for vegetation structure mapping.\nThe deep learning method used by Lang et al. (2023) is a probabilistic approach employing an ensemble of fully convolutional neural networks that fuses sparse GEDI LiDAR data with dense Sentinel-2 optical imagery, incorporating geographical context and strategies to improve the accuracy.\nM. Chen et al. (2023) proposed a novel deep learning framework called the multi-modal attention remote sensing network (MARSNet). The MARSNet architecture is based on an encoder-decoder structure. A crucial aspect is the use of separate, identical encoders for each remote sensing data modality. These modalities include Sentinel-1 C-band SAR, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, Sentinel-2 optical data, and ancillary data (NASADEM elevation and slope, latitude and longitude). This design prevents interference between different data types during feature extraction. They used dominant height derived from GEDI relative heights (RH) metrics as labels. Finally, a shared decoder takes the fused features from all modalities and estimates the dominant height.\n\n\n\n\nThe main directions identified for future research on GEDI + EO data integration were:\n\nImproving Model Generalizability: Developing models that can be applied across diverse ecosystems and regions. (Location embeddings)\nEnhancing Data Fusion Techniques: Exploring innovative methods to combine GEDI with other - spaceborne LiDAR and EO data. (Multi modal DL)\n\n\n\n\nHunka et al.

    "text": "There is a lot of challenges for before and after disturbance comparisons using GEDI data (East et al. 2023; Mandl et al. 2023; Huettermann et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis: If comparability is compromised due to errors associated to specific covariates (e.g. Topography, Land Cover, Tree species), then a method could be developed to mitigate those errors and make pairs more comparable.\n\n\nProposed outcome: A systematic way to get comparable GEDI metrics which takes into account errors associated to topographic, landscape and vegatation covariates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat methods have been used to obtain comparable space-borne LiDAR measurements?\nWhat are the main challenges and best practices in comparing measurements from GEDI, ICESat-2, or other space-borne LiDAR datasets and how do researchers deal with them?\nWhat pre-processing techniques (e.g. filtering, interpolation) have been used?\nHow can accurate comparability be assessed?\n\n\n\nHolcomb et al. (2024) developed a method to examine forest changes using nearby GEDI footprints. These nearby GEDI footprints were chosen using a 40 meter threshold. They showed that GEDI is able to capture biomass/canopy height losses after disturbances in a 30x30m resolution and at a population level.\nDifferent approaches not using spatially coincident pairs have also been considered before. For instance, to study the effects of fires in Portugal and Spain, Guerra-Hernández et al. (2024) aggregated GEDI footpints overlapping the burned area, before and after the fire occured. With this they estimated the average AGBD loss caused by the fire.\n\n\n\nFactors that can lead to systematic biases in canopy height estimations, complicating comparisons:\n\n\nGEDI footprints have a geo-location error of approximately 10.2 m. Low geolocation accuracy can cause errors on the calculation of ground elevation. Moreover, on heterogenous canopies, geolocation error can cause the measurement to be taken over a different part of the canopy than the one presented.\nBig improvements related to geolocation error have taken place passing from GEDI v1 to v2 (Pronk, Eleveld, and Ledoux 2024). Additionally, researchers have also worked on improving the geolocation accuracy using high-res DEMs (Schleich et al. 2023).\n\n\n\nThe terrain slope significantly affects spaceborne LiDAR measurements. On sloped terrain, laser pulses reflect from both vegetation and the ground simultaneously, leading to overlapping signals and complicating the separation of canopy and ground returns (Ji et al. 2024). The maximum error for rh estimation associated to sloped terrains can be modeled as \\(max(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{2}*D*tan(slope)\\) and is presented on Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Error on vertical accuracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Effect of slope on canopy height estimation. Taken from Ji et al. (2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen actual pairs are found, another big challenge is to evaluate if these pairs can be comparable based on what has happened during the time between shots. East et al. (2023) found for instance that structural changes vary as a function of time after disturbance (Initially seen on lower layers, then on upper canopy).\nThe time between GEDI pairs used for the study on the amazon rainforest range from 5 to 1422 dyas with an average of time between shots of 522 days.\n\n\n\nFor the specific case of ground elevation, Urbazaev et al. (2022) assessed the effects of different landcovers on the accuracy of GEDI and ICESat’s estimations. They found that mean errors were less than 1m for all LC except for tropical forests where errors ranged from 1.75 to 5.56 meters.\nIn forests with dense, multi-layered canopies, the GEDI laser pulse might be intercepted by upper canopy elements, preventing it from reaching the ground. This can lead to an overestimation of canopy height or an inaccurate ground elevation reading, affecting the overall height calculation.\nAn initial experiment was performed using pairs of GEDI measurements that overlap with MODIS BA on different types of land cover. The results are shown on Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Difference beween pairs of GEDI shots on different land covers where fires have occured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, LiDAR data collected in leaf-on and leaf-off conditions can vary due to seasonal changes in canopy structure and density. Few studies have explored how using GEDI data from different seasons affects forest height estimation. M. Chen et al. (2023) showed seasonal variations on gedi RH98 measurements. Nevertheless, these variations were attributed to differing GEDI locations rather than seasonality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHolcomb et al. (2024) applied several filtering stpes to the GEDI data used on their study. The main ones are described in the table below:\n\nFilters used by Holcomb et al. (2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering Step\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nRemoval of low-quality shots\nGEDI shots flagged as low quality by NASA were discarded to retain only reliable measurements.\n\n\nExclusion of periods with high geolocation error\nData collected during periods of above-average geolocation error were excluded (GEDI v2 error: 10.2 m).\n\n\nFiltering based on beam sensitivity\nShots with insufficient sensitivity to penetrate the canopy were removed (sensitivity &gt; 0.98 required).\n\n\nExclusion of non-forest areas\nShots over water or urban areas were filtered out, as GEDI is designed to study vegetation structure.\n\n\nComparison with TanDEM-X elevation data\nShots with large discrepancies between GEDI and TanDEM-X elevation estimates were excluded.\n\n\n\nPronk, Eleveld, and Ledoux (2024) filters were:\n\nFilters used by Pronk, Eleveld, and Ledoux (2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering Flag\nCondition\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nrx_assess_quality_flag\nNon-zero\nExcludes shots with low overall signal quality.\n\n\nsurface_flag\nNon-zero\nEnsures a ground surface return was detected.\n\n\ndegrade_flag\nZero\nIncludes only shots where the data was not degraded.\n\n\n\nFinally, Milenković et al.

(2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nSubstep\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nInitial Data Selection\n\nStarted with GEDI Level 2A v2 data collected over six months, containing ~10.9 million geolocated footprints.\n\n\nPre-processing Filters\n\nApplied two main filters to clean the initial dataset:\n\n\n\nSecondary Forest Filter\nSelected only GEDI shots overlapping with secondary forest pixels (stand age &gt; 0) in Rondônia state.\n\n\n\nErroneous Forest Height Filter\nExcluded shots with RH98 values &lt; 0 or &gt; 75 m to remove implausible height measurements.\n\n\nStratification into Subgroups\n\nSplit the remaining shots into subgroups based on acquisition parameters:\n\n\n\nQuality and Degradation Flags\nCreated subgroups (e.g., QS90) including only shots with quality flag = 1 and degradation flag = 0.\n\n\n\nBeam Sensitivity Thresholds\nQS90 was divided into QS95, QS98, and QS99 based on sensitivity thresholds (0.95, 0.98, 0.99).\n\n\n\nAlgorithm Setting Group for Sensitivity\nFormed subgroups (e.g., ALL-S2, QS90-S2) using RH98 values but with sensitivity from Algorithm Setting Group 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods to improve the comparability of space-borne LiDAR pairs have been developed recently (Specifically, these methods could improve the vertical accuracy of GEDI). Ji et al. (2024) used overlapping pairs of GEDI and ICE-Sat to improve the calculation of ground elevation and thus ameliorate the canopy height calculations. These overlapping pairs were then used to assess their capability to detect deforestation in Brazil. The steps followed are described on Figure 4, Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Graphical description of Ji et al. (2024) pre-processing techniques\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Pre-processing for Improved Ground Identification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nNoise Removal and Signal Range Definition\nRaw waveform data from ICESat/GLAS and GEDI is processed to eliminate noise using a Gaussian filter and a signal range threshold above the noise level.\n\n\nWaveform Decomposition\nThe valid signal range is decomposed into multiple Gaussian components using the Progressive Waveform Decomposition (PWD) algorithm, representing layers like canopy or ground.\n\n\nInitial Ground Return Selection\nFor overlapping footprints (centers within 50m), Gaussian components are shortlisted as potential ground returns, starting from lower elevations until 50% of waveform energy is accumulated.\n\n\nObjective Function Construction\nAn objective function is built to assess the best matching Gaussian components (one from GLAS, one from GEDI) based on similarity in center position (u) and width (σ).\n\n\nMinimizing the Objective Function\nThe objective function is minimized to find the optimal ground return pair, correcting for ground elevation differences caused by terrain slope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Pre-processing for slope correction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nTerrain Slope and Aspect Calculation\nSlope (θ) and aspect (αAspect) are calculated using DEM data (e.g., SRTM DEM) with a moving window approach to account for terrain influences.\n\n\nGround Center Offset Prediction (ΔhCofG)\nUsing slope, aspect, distance (d), and azimuth (αAzimuth) between footprints, the ground center offset is predicted and incorporated into the objective function.\n\n\nCorrection in Canopy Height Variation (Δhc)\nAfter ground components are identified, the predicted ground offset (ΔhCofG) is applied to adjust canopy height variation (Δhc), removing slope-induced errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother possible pre-processing approach to improve the collection of comparable GEDI pairs could be done through the stratification of GEDI data. For instance, L. Chen et al. (2023) performed a geographic stratification based on topographic and vegetation features to map AGB at the Jilin Province in Northeast China integrating GEDI data, SAR and MSI. Their results showed that using a stratified sample technique improved the accuracy of AGB estimates by up to 34.8%.\n\n\n\n\n\n(NOT SURE IF THIS SHOULD BE HERE OR ON OBJ. 2)\n\n\n\nData from PNOA LiDAR project in Spain is freely accessible and could be used to check on vegetation structure parameters (1ra cobertura until 2015, 2da cobertura until 2022)\n\nThis data could be used for many things:\n\nSimulation of structural changes over time as a space-for-time substitution (Check gradient of different structural variables).\nHigh resolution assessment of vegetaion structural changes after fire.\nCreation of simulated footprints for pre-fire measurements and then combination with real GEDI footprints (Like Huettermann et al.

Ji et al. (2024) used overlapping pairs of GEDI and ICE-Sat to improve the calculation of ground elevation and thus ameliorate the canopy height calculations. These overlapping pairs were then used to assess their capability to detect deforestation in Brazil. The steps followed are described on Figure 4, Table 1 and Table 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Graphical description of Ji et al.

For instance, L. Chen et al. (2023) performed a geographic stratification based on topographic and vegetation features to map AGB at the Jilin Province in Northeast China integrating GEDI data, SAR and MSI. Their results showed that using a stratified sample technique improved the accuracy of AGB estimates by up to 34.8%.\n\n\n\n\n\n(NOT SURE IF THIS SHOULD BE HERE OR ON OBJ. 2)\n\n\n\nData from PNOA LiDAR project in Spain is freely accessible and could be used to check on vegetation structure parameters (1ra cobertura until 2015, 2da cobertura until 2022)\n\nThis data could be used for many things:\n\nSimulation of structural changes over time as a space-for-time substitution (Check gradient of different structural variables).\nHigh resolution assessment of vegetaion structural changes after fire.\nCreation of simulated footprints for pre-fire measurements and then combination with real GEDI footprints (Like Huettermann et al. (2023)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome examples to obtain GEDI pairs using the gediDB package developed by Besnard, Dombrowski, and Holcomb (2025) are presented here."

    "text": "SatCLIP: Global, General-Purpose Location Embeddings with Satellite Imagery\n\nIntroduction\n\nSatellite imagery is a valuable input data for predictive models across a wide range of real-world applications.\nMany geospatial models also directly leverage geographic location for improving predictions.\nIntegrating geographic information into a deep learning model is not straightforward.\nIntroducing spatial coordinates as features can amplify geographic distribution shift problems and lead to poor evaluation accuracy.\nMany location-informed models are only applicable for interpolation problems where the evaluation area overlaps with the training area.\nThis work addresses the research problem by pretraining location encoders with globally and uniformly sampled satellite imagery and with general-purpose use in mind.\n\n\n\nSatellite Contrastive Location-Image Pretraining\n\nSatCLIP learns an implicit representation of locations by matching CNN and ViT inferred visual patterns of openly available satellite imagery with their geographic coordinates.\nThe resulting location encoder efficiently summarizes the characteristics of any given location for convenient use in downstream tasks.\nThe paper motivates SatCLIP and then outlines its components and training paradigm.\nSatCLIP has the potential to provide the best of both worlds: location embeddings capture both spatial effects and ground conditions while also being low-dimensional and runtime-efficient.\n\n\nPretraining with the SatCLIP Objective\n\nDescribes the inputs to the geographic location encoder.\nDefines two encoders: a location encoder and an image encoder.\nDescribes the CLIP objective for training both encoders.\nThis objective simultaneously optimizes the weights of the location encoder and image encoder to embed the feature vectors of the corresponding location and image nearby in a common d-dimensional feature space.\n\n\n\nEncoder Architectures\n\nGeographic location encoders typically take the form of a small neural network (NN) applied to a nonparametric, functional positional encoding of the coordinates.\nThis work trains Siren(SH) location encoders proposed by Rußwurm et al., which use spherical harmonics basis (SH) functions as positional encoders and are particularly well-suited for coordinates on spherical surfaces.\nThey are combined with sinusoidal representation networks (Siren), which are broadly used for implicit neural representations.\nThe spatial smoothness of the representation is controlled by the number of Legendre polynomials L.\nAs an image encoder, they need a vision model that is expressive enough to learn visual patterns from satellite images.\nIn this work, they use ResNet18, ResNet50, and ViT16 vision encoders pretrained with momentum-contrast (MoCo) on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.\n\n\n\nSatCLIP Implementation Details\n\nSatCLIP is pretrained using the S2-100K dataset, which is assembled for this purpose.\n90% of the data points, selected uniformly at random, are used for pretraining and the remaining 10% is reserved as a validation set to monitor overfitting.\nModels are trained for 500 epochs on an A100 GPU.\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Setup\n\nThe paper focuses on three research questions:\nHow generalizable are SatCLIP embeddings from Sentinel-2 data, both across a diverse range of geospatial modeling tasks (RQ 1) and across unseen geographic areas (RQ 2), compared to existing pretrained location encoders and location-only prediction?\nDo SatCLIP embeddings capture ground conditions and incorporate similarities over space? (RQ 3).\nExperiments are designed to test the performance of SatCLIP embeddings for downstream tasks, both for spatial interpolation, and for geographic domain generalization.\nGeographic generalization is an important aspect of performance as distributional shifts across geographic areas are a common challenge in environmental problems.\n\n\nPretraining Dataset: 100k uniformly sampled Sentinel-2 images\n\nTo construct their pretraining dataset, S2-100K, they sample 100,000 tiles of 256×256 pixel, multi-spectral (12-channel) Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and their associated centroid locations.\nThe S2-100K dataset is designed with the goals of multi-task applicability and geographic generalization performance in mind.\nUnlike S2-100K, pretraining datasets used in comparison methods often significantly underrepresent certain—especially non-Western—geographic areas as they were not specifically designed to provide general-purpose embeddings.\n\n\n\nDownstream Tasks\n\nTo test the general applicability of SatCLIP location embeddings, experiments are run on a wide range of geospatial predictive modeling tasks.\nThe nine downstream datasets used in this work span socioeconomic and environmental applications.\n\n\n\nComparison Methods\n\nThe trained SatCLIP location embeddings are compared to GPS2Vec, CSP, and GeoCLIP pretrained location embeddings.\nTo compare to an image-only embedding, globally precomputed MOSAIKS features are used.\nTo assess the performance improvement from the integration of contextual information over location-only prediction, they also compare to downstream learners trained on raw latitude/longitude coordinates.\n\n\n\nDownstream Model Training\n\nFor all downstream tasks, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models are trained with location embeddings and raw latitude/longitude coordinates as input to predict a (continuous or discrete) outcome variable.\nRegression models use a mean squared error (MSE) loss and classification models use a cross-entropy loss.\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\nThis section presents the results of the experiments.\n\n\nDownstream Task Performance (RQ 1)\n\nSatCLIP embeddings (in either L = 10 or L = 40 configuration) achieve the best prediction scores by a large margin on seven of the nine tasks.\nThe exceptions are the Cali. Housing dataset, which is limited to California, and the Median Income dataset, which only contains data from the continental United States (US).\nSatCLIP performs well on all continents for both tasks.\nPrior location encoders (CSP and GPS2Vec) trained on spatially biased training data tend to perform better in Europe and North America than in the underrepresented continents of Africa, Asia, and South America.\n\n\n\nZero/Few-Shot Geographic Adaptation (RQ 2)\n\nSatCLIP models are often (but not always) better than the comparison approaches across both held-out continents.\nOverall, SatCLIP embeddings perform systematically better in the few-shot geographic adaptation setting for Ecoregions and Countries tasks.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Location Embeddings (RQ 3)\n\nThey investigate qualitatively to what degree the SatCLIP embeddings have learned an implicit representation of different ground conditions in the location encoder weights.\nSatCLIP location embeddings show high similarity between the Congo Basin location and other areas close to the Equator, particularly the Amazon and Indonesia.\nIn comparison, embeddings of the North American location are similar to areas in Europe or northern China that are similarly population-dense and industrialized.\n\n\n\nEffect of Location and Image Encoder Design on\n\nThe choice of image encoder for pretraining (ViT-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-50) appears to only marginally affect results.\nIn contrast, different location encoder resolutions with scale parameters L = 10 and L = 40 have a greater effect.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nSatCLIP models can provide useful information for a wide range of downstream tasks, with the concrete benefit varying across tasks.\nSatCLIP embeddings perform well across continents and are less prone to geographic bias in comparison to other methods like GPS2Vec or CSP.\nThe transfer of spatial patterns in Sentinel-2 imagery into the SatCLIP location encoder enables generalization across geographic areas.\nAt test time, SatCLIP location encoders can be applied directly to any point on the globe, without needing to download additional imagery.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nSatCLIP is a method to learn an implicit neural representation of visual patterns on the globe by matching satellite images and their respective coordinates using a contrastive location-image pretraining objective.\nExperiments show that SatCLIP is effective for global prediction tasks spanning social and environmental domains, for both interpolation and out-of-sample geographic prediction.\nTwo key factors contribute to the performance:\nTheir S2-100K pretraining dataset is uniformly distributed across the globe.\nThey use the recently proposed Siren(SH) location encoder which has proven well-suited for the global-scale representation of data on the spherical Earth."

    "text": "Characterizing the structural complexity of the Earth’s forests with spaceborne lidar\n\nMain ideas\n\nForest structural complexity has a major influence on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity.\nA 3D canopy complexity data product was derived from space-borne LiDAR (GEDI) measurements (data).\n\nTrained with ALS 3D complexity measurements (In-situ).\n\n(🌎 Spatial variations) Highest complexity is present in tropical forests and this complexity is related to canopy attributes from lower and middle story.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nForest structural complexity is a function of the heterogeneity of canopy structure in tri-dimensional space.\n\nDetermined by:\n\n🌳Tree diameter\n📏 Height\n🌲 Biomass\n🍃Leaf angle\n🪵 Deadwood\nVertical layering\n\n\nGEDI waveforms record vertical distribution of leaves and branches from top of canopy to ground.\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nGEDI records vertical variations. Assuming that vertical and horizontal variations are related, authors tried to inferred 3D complexity out of GEDI records alone.\n\n800,000 measured values of CE\\(_{xyz}\\) were used to model the structural complexity.\n\nExtreme gradient boosted trees regression model was trained \\[ CE_{xyz} = XGBoost(GEDI_{L2}) \\]\nSeparate regression models were developed for each plant functional type (PFT): Evergreen Broadleef Trees (EBT), Deciduous Broadleef Tree (DBT), Evergreen Needleaf Trees (ENT) and Grasslands Shrublands, and Woodlands (GSW).\nModel uncertainty was quantified using conformal predictors (?).\nSpatial cross-validation was used to assess the performance.\nA PCA was performed to understand relationship between WSCI and other structural variables (e.g. PAI, tree cover)\nA PCR (regression) was performed including and excluding the WSCI to check if it gives additional information not given by other GEDI metrics.\nLinear regression beteen WSCI and modeled and canopy height to check power law scaling relationships.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nThe models resulted in a R\\(^{2}\\) of 68% in the training data.\nHighest errors in regions of sparse tree cover (e.g. Grasslands, shrublands, woodlands). GEDI is not optimized to measure vert. structure of short plants (e.g. 2-3m)\n\nHeterosceasticity (Variance of errors increase as complexity decreases).\n\nVertical complexity is better predicted (75%) than horizontal complexity (40%). Also it is mainly predicted by upper strata metrics.\n\nExplained by: As canopy height increases, vertical layering also develops, increasing tree density.\n\n\n\nGlobal patterns\n\nLatitudinal pattern: Higher WSCI in tropics (🌱 🌿 🌳), decrease on higher latitudes (🌲).\nComplexity in tropical forests depends more on lower and middle layers, while on temperate forests more strongly on upper layers.\n\n\n\nComplexity \\(\\propto\\) other structural elements\n\nPCA shows that forest density (PC1, (PAI, Tree cover)) captures broad-scale differences between regions and, vertical stratification and canopy height (PC2, (FHD, RH98, WSCI)) captures variations within these regions.\nPCRs show that WSCI capures 11% of variation no included on other GEDI metrics.\n\n\n\nComplexity and height\n\nRelationship between WSCI and canopy height can be described by a power law with scaling exponents that differ depending on region (Tropical, Temperate, Others).\nTall forests are more complex, but in tropical forests short forests are also complex. This makes them special.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points\n\nEven though RH metrics are correlated among themselves, the division into three strata weakens that correlation. Thus, making them useful for modeling.\nStructural complexity is 3D (So also horizontal), the modelling of WSCI relies on inference of horizontal complexity from rel. with vertical complexity.\nPower-law scaling varies greatly depending on biomes. This is associated to differences in tree species, competition and other ecological dynamics.\nWSCI could be useful to assess forest degradation (e.g. comparing it with potential structural complexity). However, take with grain of salt cause methods to calculate potential and actual complexity differ.\nFusion models are needed to improve spatial scale and this could also help improve models on areas with sparse tree cover.\nWSCI serves as an integrator of various structural metrics, but still much remains to understand abour structural complexity (i.e. How it develops, how it may be managed, what implies on ecosystem functioning)"

    "text": "Tracking Changes in Vegetation Structure Following Fire in the Cerrado Biome Using ICESat-2\nBIG FOCUS ON SAVANNAS\n\nKey Themes\n\nFire impacts on vegetation structure in the Cerrado biome\nThe use of NASA’s ICESat-2 lidar data to quantify these impacts\nThe slow recovery of woody vegetation after fire\nThe influence of precipitation on post-fire recovery\nThe contrasting fire regimes in managed and unmanaged Cerrado landscapes\n\n\n\nMost Important Ideas/Facts\n\nThe study leverages the unique capabilities of ICESat-2 lidar data to provide a biome-wide assessment of the impact of fire on woody vegetation height and canopy cover in the Brazilian Cerrado.\nThe study found that both canopy height and cover decrease with increasing fire frequency across all natural vegetation classes. This is consistent with previous plot-based studies, but the ICESat-2 data provides a much broader spatial perspective.\nThe research reveals that post-fire recovery of woody vegetation in the Cerrado is slower than expected, taking decades for canopy height to recover. This finding challenges the common assumption of rapid recovery in this fire-adapted ecosystem.\nCanopy cover recovers more quickly than canopy height, returning to pre-burn levels within 5 years for forests in wetter areas. This highlights the importance of considering both height and cover when assessing fire impacts.\nPrecipitation plays a crucial role in post-fire recovery, with faster recovery rates observed in areas receiving more rainfall. The study emphasizes the interplay between fire and climate in shaping Cerrado vegetation.\nManaged Cerrado landscapes, such as pastures, show a muted response to fire compared to natural vegetation. This reflects the altered fire regimes and land management practices in these areas.\n\n\n\nKey Quotes\n\n“Fire is one of the factors that contributes to the structural heterogeneity of the Cerrado. As a mesic savanna, the Cerrado biome can support both savannas and forests as distinct and stable alternative states.”\n“New satellite LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, henceforth referred to as lidar, provide a broad sample of ecosystem structure across the Cerrado.”\n“The decline in mean canopy height averaged 40 cm per fire in forests and 30 cm per fire in savannas. The mean height loss in response to increasing fire frequency was consistent across precipitation zones within forests and savannas.”\n“Our results suggest that canopy height and percent cover decline with increasing fire frequency for all natural vegetation classes.”\n“Precipitation has a substantial impact on the canopy height recovery for forests, savannas, and grasslands, with higher recovery rates in areas receiving &gt;1,500 mm rainfall.”\n“Lidar-derived measures of 3-D structure suggest that post-fire recovery of woody vegetation in the Cerrado is slower than expected for one of the wettest savanna biomes.”\n\n\n\nImplications\n\nThe slow recovery of woody vegetation following fire has significant implications for carbon storage in the Cerrado and needs to be accounted for in carbon cycle models.\nThe study’s findings underscore the importance of fire management strategies that consider the long-term impacts of fire on vegetation structure.\nThe use of ICESat-2 data opens up new possibilities for monitoring vegetation dynamics and understanding the role of fire in shaping savanna ecosystems globally.\n\n\n\nFuture research\n\nThe study acknowledges the limitations of the space-for-time substitution approach and suggests future research using repeat-track ICESat-2 data to directly measure fire-induced changes in vegetation structure. (What Amelia did)\nFurther investigation into the influence of fire severity, topography, and adjacent land use on post-fire recovery is recommended.\nExploring the applicability of ICESat-2 data for monitoring fire impacts in other savanna ecosystems worldwide is encouraged.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrates the power of ICESat-2 lidar data for revealing the complex interactions between fire and vegetation in the Cerrado biome. The findings challenge conventional wisdom about the resilience of savanna ecosystems to fire and provide valuable insights for conservation efforts and carbon cycle modeling. The research paves the way for a deeper understanding of the role of fire in shaping savanna landscapes globally."

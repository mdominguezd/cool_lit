    "text": "Remote sensing for wildfire monitoring: Insights into burned area, emissions, and fire dynamics (2024)\n\nMain takeaways for me\n\nDivided the paper into RS for BA, FE and AF.\nThermal imagers, which detect the infrared radiation emitted by fires, are the primary tools for real-time monitoring of AFs. Burning vegetation at temperatures between 500°C and 1,200°C emits significantly more infrared radiation than its surroundings.\nThe Global Fire Emissions Database BA (GFED BA) combines information from multiple satellite platforms to obtain better BA datasets, using the MODIS MCD64 BA product as its primary input. AF data from the ATSR and VIRS sensors are used to extend the data record prior to the MODIS era.\n\n\nMethods for using remotely sensed data to estimate fire emissions.\n\nThe formula for estimating gas and aerosol species emitted from fires (E) follows several sequential steps: Ei = A × B × C × EFi, where A is the area burned; B is the biomass available per area; C is combustion completeness, representing the fraction of biomass actually consumed; and EFi is the emission factor for species i. (This approach has produced most of the current fire emissions datasets, including GFED, FLAMBE, GICC, WFEIS, MFLEI, and FINN) (Bottom-up approach)\nPhysically based on the linear correlation between remotely sensed fire radiative energy and biomass consumed in fires, independent of vegetation type. (Top-down approach)\nSatellite instruments measure atmospheric concentrations of fire-emitted pollutants (CO, NOx, CO2) and integrate these with atmospheric inversion.\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nAF detections often suffer from false alarms due to bright surfaces reflecting sunlight that cannot be completely screened out using available image bands.\nBA algorithms can misinterpret land-use changes as fire activity\nSmall, cool, understory, and sub-surface fires are frequently omitted.\nBIG DOMAIN ADAPTATION POTENTIAL: Data integration poses additional challenges. Developing algorithms that perform well globally is difficult due to regional differences in vegetation, fire behavior, and climate.\n\n\n\n\nRS workflow for fire monitoring\n\n\n\nTaken from: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332224002574"

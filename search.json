    "text": "Characterizing the structural complexity of the Earth’s forests with spaceborne lidar\n\nMain ideas\n\nForest structural complexity has a major influence on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity.\nA 3D canopy complexity data product was derived from space-borne LiDAR (GEDI) measurements (data).\n\nTrained with ALS 3D complexity measurements (In-situ).\n\n(🌎 Spatial variations) Highest complexity is present in tropical forests and this complexity is related to canopy attributes from lower and middle story.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nForest structural complexity is a function of the heterogeneity of canopy structure in tri-dimensional space.\n\nDetermined by:\n\n🌳Tree diameter\n📏 Height\n🌲 Biomass\n🍃Leaf angle\n🪵 Deadwood\nVertical layering\n\n\nGEDI waveforms record vertical distribution of leaves and branches from top of canopy to ground.\n\n\n\nMethods\n\nGEDI records vertical variations. Assuming that vertical and horizontal variations are related, authors tried to inferred 3D complexity out of GEDI records alone.\n\n800,000 measured values of CE\\(_{xyz}\\) were used to model the structural complexity.\n\nExtreme gradient boosted trees regression model was trained \\[ CE_{xyz} = XGBoost(GEDI_{L2}) \\]\nSeparate regression models were developed for each plant functional type (PFT): Evergreen Broadleef Trees (EBT), Deciduous Broadleef Tree (DBT), Evergreen Needleaf Trees (ENT) and Grasslands Shrublands, and Woodlands (GSW).\nModel uncertainty was quantified using conformal predictors (?).\nSpatial cross-validation was used to assess the performance.\nA PCA was performed to understand relationship between WSCI and other structural variables (e.g. PAI, tree cover)\nA PCR (regression) was performed including and excluding the WSCI to check if it gives additional information not given by other GEDI metrics.\nLinear regression beteen WSCI and modeled and canopy height to check power law scaling relationships.\n\n\n\nResults\n\nThe models resulted in a R\\(^{2}\\) of 68% in the training data.\nHighest errors in regions of sparse tree cover (e.g. Grasslands, shrublands, woodlands). GEDI is not optimized to measure vert. structure of short plants (e.g. 2-3m)\n\nHeterosceasticity (Variance of errors increase as complexity decreases).\n\nVertical complexity is better predicted (75%) than horizontal complexity (40%). Also it is mainly predicted by upper strata metrics.\n\nExplained by: As canopy height increases, vertical layering also develops, increasing tree density.\n\n\n\nGlobal patterns\n\nLatitudinal pattern: Higher WSCI in tropics (🌱 🌿 🌳), decrease on higher latitudes (🌲).\nComplexity in tropical forests depends more on lower and middle layers, while on temperate forests more strongly on upper layers.\n\n\n\nComplexity \\(\\propto\\) other structural elements\n\nPCA shows that forest density (PC1, (PAI, Tree cover)) captures broad-scale differences between regions and, vertical stratification and canopy height (PC2, (FHD, RH98, WSCI)) captures variations within these regions.\nPCRs show that WSCI capures 11% of variation no included on other GEDI metrics.\n\n\n\nComplexity and height\n\nRelationship between WSCI and canopy height can be described by a power law with scaling exponents that differ depending on region (Tropical, Temperate, Others).\nTall forests are more complex, but in tropical forests short forests are also complex. This makes them special.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion points\n\nEven though RH metrics are correlated among themselves, the division into three strata weakens that correlation. Thus, making them useful for modeling.\nStructural complexity is 3D (So also horizontal), the modelling of WSCI relies on inference of horizontal complexity from rel. with vertical complexity.\nPower-law scaling varies greatly depending on biomes. This is associated to differences in tree species, competition and other ecological dynamics.\nWSCI could be useful to assess forest degradation (e.g. comparing it with potential structural complexity). However, take with grain of salt cause methods to calculate potential and actual complexity differ.\nFusion models are needed to improve spatial scale and this could also help improve models on areas with sparse tree cover.\nWSCI serves as an integrator of various structural metrics, but still much remains to understand abour structural complexity (i.e. How it develops, how it may be managed, what implies on ecosystem functioning)"

    "text": "Tracking Changes in Vegetation Structure Following Fire in the Cerrado Biome Using ICESat-2\nBIG FOCUS ON SAVANNAS\n\nKey Themes\n\nFire impacts on vegetation structure in the Cerrado biome\nThe use of NASA’s ICESat-2 lidar data to quantify these impacts\nThe slow recovery of woody vegetation after fire\nThe influence of precipitation on post-fire recovery\nThe contrasting fire regimes in managed and unmanaged Cerrado landscapes\n\n\n\nMost Important Ideas/Facts\n\nThe study leverages the unique capabilities of ICESat-2 lidar data to provide a biome-wide assessment of the impact of fire on woody vegetation height and canopy cover in the Brazilian Cerrado.\nThe study found that both canopy height and cover decrease with increasing fire frequency across all natural vegetation classes. This is consistent with previous plot-based studies, but the ICESat-2 data provides a much broader spatial perspective.\nThe research reveals that post-fire recovery of woody vegetation in the Cerrado is slower than expected, taking decades for canopy height to recover. This finding challenges the common assumption of rapid recovery in this fire-adapted ecosystem.\nCanopy cover recovers more quickly than canopy height, returning to pre-burn levels within 5 years for forests in wetter areas. This highlights the importance of considering both height and cover when assessing fire impacts.\nPrecipitation plays a crucial role in post-fire recovery, with faster recovery rates observed in areas receiving more rainfall. The study emphasizes the interplay between fire and climate in shaping Cerrado vegetation.\nManaged Cerrado landscapes, such as pastures, show a muted response to fire compared to natural vegetation. This reflects the altered fire regimes and land management practices in these areas.\n\n\n\nKey Quotes\n\n“Fire is one of the factors that contributes to the structural heterogeneity of the Cerrado. As a mesic savanna, the Cerrado biome can support both savannas and forests as distinct and stable alternative states.”\n“New satellite LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, henceforth referred to as lidar, provide a broad sample of ecosystem structure across the Cerrado.”\n“The decline in mean canopy height averaged 40 cm per fire in forests and 30 cm per fire in savannas. The mean height loss in response to increasing fire frequency was consistent across precipitation zones within forests and savannas.”\n“Our results suggest that canopy height and percent cover decline with increasing fire frequency for all natural vegetation classes.”\n“Precipitation has a substantial impact on the canopy height recovery for forests, savannas, and grasslands, with higher recovery rates in areas receiving &gt;1,500 mm rainfall.”\n“Lidar-derived measures of 3-D structure suggest that post-fire recovery of woody vegetation in the Cerrado is slower than expected for one of the wettest savanna biomes.”\n\n\n\nImplications\n\nThe slow recovery of woody vegetation following fire has significant implications for carbon storage in the Cerrado and needs to be accounted for in carbon cycle models.\nThe study’s findings underscore the importance of fire management strategies that consider the long-term impacts of fire on vegetation structure.\nThe use of ICESat-2 data opens up new possibilities for monitoring vegetation dynamics and understanding the role of fire in shaping savanna ecosystems globally.\n\n\n\nFuture research\n\nThe study acknowledges the limitations of the space-for-time substitution approach and suggests future research using repeat-track ICESat-2 data to directly measure fire-induced changes in vegetation structure. (What Amelia did)\nFurther investigation into the influence of fire severity, topography, and adjacent land use on post-fire recovery is recommended.\nExploring the applicability of ICESat-2 data for monitoring fire impacts in other savanna ecosystems worldwide is encouraged.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrates the power of ICESat-2 lidar data for revealing the complex interactions between fire and vegetation in the Cerrado biome. The findings challenge conventional wisdom about the resilience of savanna ecosystems to fire and provide valuable insights for conservation efforts and carbon cycle modeling. The research paves the way for a deeper understanding of the role of fire in shaping savanna landscapes globally."

    "text": "Remote sensing for wildfire monitoring: Insights into burned area, emissions, and fire dynamics (2024)\n\nMain takeaways for me\n\nDivided the paper into RS for BA, FE and AF.\nThermal imagers, which detect the infrared radiation emitted by fires, are the primary tools for real-time monitoring of AFs. Burning vegetation at temperatures between 500°C and 1,200°C emits significantly more infrared radiation than its surroundings.\nThe Global Fire Emissions Database BA (GFED BA) combines information from multiple satellite platforms to obtain better BA datasets, using the MODIS MCD64 BA product as its primary input. AF data from the ATSR and VIRS sensors are used to extend the data record prior to the MODIS era.\n\n\nMethods for using remotely sensed data to estimate fire emissions.\n\nThe formula for estimating gas and aerosol species emitted from fires (E) follows several sequential steps: Ei = A × B × C × EFi, where A is the area burned; B is the biomass available per area; C is combustion completeness, representing the fraction of biomass actually consumed; and EFi is the emission factor for species i. (This approach has produced most of the current fire emissions datasets, including GFED, FLAMBE, GICC, WFEIS, MFLEI, and FINN) (Bottom-up approach)\nPhysically based on the linear correlation between remotely sensed fire radiative energy and biomass consumed in fires, independent of vegetation type. (Top-down approach)\nSatellite instruments measure atmospheric concentrations of fire-emitted pollutants (CO, NOx, CO2) and integrate these with atmospheric inversion.\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nAF detections often suffer from false alarms due to bright surfaces reflecting sunlight that cannot be completely screened out using available image bands.\nBA algorithms can misinterpret land-use changes as fire activity\nSmall, cool, understory, and sub-surface fires are frequently omitted.\nBIG DOMAIN ADAPTATION POTENTIAL: Data integration poses additional challenges. Developing algorithms that perform well globally is difficult due to regional differences in vegetation, fire behavior, and climate.\n\n\n\n\nRS workflow for fire monitoring\n\n\n\nTaken from: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332224002574"

    "text": "SatCLIP: Global, General-Purpose Location Embeddings with Satellite Imagery\n\nIntroduction\n\nSatellite imagery is a valuable input data for predictive models across a wide range of real-world applications.\nMany geospatial models also directly leverage geographic location for improving predictions.\nIntegrating geographic information into a deep learning model is not straightforward.\nIntroducing spatial coordinates as features can amplify geographic distribution shift problems and lead to poor evaluation accuracy.\nMany location-informed models are only applicable for interpolation problems where the evaluation area overlaps with the training area.\nThis work addresses the research problem by pretraining location encoders with globally and uniformly sampled satellite imagery and with general-purpose use in mind.\n\n\n\nSatellite Contrastive Location-Image Pretraining\n\nSatCLIP learns an implicit representation of locations by matching CNN and ViT inferred visual patterns of openly available satellite imagery with their geographic coordinates.\nThe resulting location encoder efficiently summarizes the characteristics of any given location for convenient use in downstream tasks.\nThe paper motivates SatCLIP and then outlines its components and training paradigm.\nSatCLIP has the potential to provide the best of both worlds: location embeddings capture both spatial effects and ground conditions while also being low-dimensional and runtime-efficient.\n\n\nPretraining with the SatCLIP Objective\n\nDescribes the inputs to the geographic location encoder.\nDefines two encoders: a location encoder and an image encoder.\nDescribes the CLIP objective for training both encoders.\nThis objective simultaneously optimizes the weights of the location encoder and image encoder to embed the feature vectors of the corresponding location and image nearby in a common d-dimensional feature space.\n\n\n\nEncoder Architectures\n\nGeographic location encoders typically take the form of a small neural network (NN) applied to a nonparametric, functional positional encoding of the coordinates.\nThis work trains Siren(SH) location encoders proposed by Rußwurm et al., which use spherical harmonics basis (SH) functions as positional encoders and are particularly well-suited for coordinates on spherical surfaces.\nThey are combined with sinusoidal representation networks (Siren), which are broadly used for implicit neural representations.\nThe spatial smoothness of the representation is controlled by the number of Legendre polynomials L.\nAs an image encoder, they need a vision model that is expressive enough to learn visual patterns from satellite images.\nIn this work, they use ResNet18, ResNet50, and ViT16 vision encoders pretrained with momentum-contrast (MoCo) on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery.\n\n\n\nSatCLIP Implementation Details\n\nSatCLIP is pretrained using the S2-100K dataset, which is assembled for this purpose.\n90% of the data points, selected uniformly at random, are used for pretraining and the remaining 10% is reserved as a validation set to monitor overfitting.\nModels are trained for 500 epochs on an A100 GPU.\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Setup\n\nThe paper focuses on three research questions:\nHow generalizable are SatCLIP embeddings from Sentinel-2 data, both across a diverse range of geospatial modeling tasks (RQ 1) and across unseen geographic areas (RQ 2), compared to existing pretrained location encoders and location-only prediction?\nDo SatCLIP embeddings capture ground conditions and incorporate similarities over space? (RQ 3).\nExperiments are designed to test the performance of SatCLIP embeddings for downstream tasks, both for spatial interpolation, and for geographic domain generalization.\nGeographic generalization is an important aspect of performance as distributional shifts across geographic areas are a common challenge in environmental problems.\n\n\nPretraining Dataset: 100k uniformly sampled Sentinel-2 images\n\nTo construct their pretraining dataset, S2-100K, they sample 100,000 tiles of 256×256 pixel, multi-spectral (12-channel) Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and their associated centroid locations.\nThe S2-100K dataset is designed with the goals of multi-task applicability and geographic generalization performance in mind.\nUnlike S2-100K, pretraining datasets used in comparison methods often significantly underrepresent certain—especially non-Western—geographic areas as they were not specifically designed to provide general-purpose embeddings.\n\n\n\nDownstream Tasks\n\nTo test the general applicability of SatCLIP location embeddings, experiments are run on a wide range of geospatial predictive modeling tasks.\nThe nine downstream datasets used in this work span socioeconomic and environmental applications.\n\n\n\nComparison Methods\n\nThe trained SatCLIP location embeddings are compared to GPS2Vec, CSP, and GeoCLIP pretrained location embeddings.\nTo compare to an image-only embedding, globally precomputed MOSAIKS features are used.\nTo assess the performance improvement from the integration of contextual information over location-only prediction, they also compare to downstream learners trained on raw latitude/longitude coordinates.\n\n\n\nDownstream Model Training\n\nFor all downstream tasks, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models are trained with location embeddings and raw latitude/longitude coordinates as input to predict a (continuous or discrete) outcome variable.\nRegression models use a mean squared error (MSE) loss and classification models use a cross-entropy loss.\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\nThis section presents the results of the experiments.\n\n\nDownstream Task Performance (RQ 1)\n\nSatCLIP embeddings (in either L = 10 or L = 40 configuration) achieve the best prediction scores by a large margin on seven of the nine tasks.\nThe exceptions are the Cali. Housing dataset, which is limited to California, and the Median Income dataset, which only contains data from the continental United States (US).\nSatCLIP performs well on all continents for both tasks.\nPrior location encoders (CSP and GPS2Vec) trained on spatially biased training data tend to perform better in Europe and North America than in the underrepresented continents of Africa, Asia, and South America.\n\n\n\nZero/Few-Shot Geographic Adaptation (RQ 2)\n\nSatCLIP models are often (but not always) better than the comparison approaches across both held-out continents.\nOverall, SatCLIP embeddings perform systematically better in the few-shot geographic adaptation setting for Ecoregions and Countries tasks.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Location Embeddings (RQ 3)\n\nThey investigate qualitatively to what degree the SatCLIP embeddings have learned an implicit representation of different ground conditions in the location encoder weights.\nSatCLIP location embeddings show high similarity between the Congo Basin location and other areas close to the Equator, particularly the Amazon and Indonesia.\nIn comparison, embeddings of the North American location are similar to areas in Europe or northern China that are similarly population-dense and industrialized.\n\n\n\nEffect of Location and Image Encoder Design on\n\nThe choice of image encoder for pretraining (ViT-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-50) appears to only marginally affect results.\nIn contrast, different location encoder resolutions with scale parameters L = 10 and L = 40 have a greater effect.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nSatCLIP models can provide useful information for a wide range of downstream tasks, with the concrete benefit varying across tasks.\nSatCLIP embeddings perform well across continents and are less prone to geographic bias in comparison to other methods like GPS2Vec or CSP.\nThe transfer of spatial patterns in Sentinel-2 imagery into the SatCLIP location encoder enables generalization across geographic areas.\nAt test time, SatCLIP location encoders can be applied directly to any point on the globe, without needing to download additional imagery.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nSatCLIP is a method to learn an implicit neural representation of visual patterns on the globe by matching satellite images and their respective coordinates using a contrastive location-image pretraining objective.\nExperiments show that SatCLIP is effective for global prediction tasks spanning social and environmental domains, for both interpolation and out-of-sample geographic prediction.\nTwo key factors contribute to the performance:\nTheir S2-100K pretraining dataset is uniformly distributed across the globe.\nThey use the recently proposed Siren(SH) location encoder which has proven well-suited for the global-scale representation of data on the spherical Earth."

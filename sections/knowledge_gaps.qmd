## Identification of knowledge gap

Some gaps that have been Identified:

- Understanding the impact of fire severity with GEDI metrics by themself it's not an easy task. (Going to the raw data)
    - Previous studies [@pascual_integrated_2023] have found that fire severity affects the energy metrics on the GEDI waveform data, but not significantly the AGBD metrics. (Although they used an patch-based approach)
    - Some patch-based approaches have been studied, but repeat GEDI measurements have not been studied deeply related to fires (Only [@holcomb_repeat_2024] did a bit).
- Geographic stratification of GEDI shots
- Biomass loss estimations using other EO datasets.
- Data fusion methods to improve the capability of using different EO data formats.

```{python}
#| echo: false
import plotly.figure_factory as ff

df = [dict(Task="Job A", Start='2009-01-01', Finish='2009-02-28'),
      dict(Task="Job B", Start='2009-03-05', Finish='2009-04-15'),
      dict(Task="Job C", Start='2009-02-20', Finish='2009-05-30')]

fig = ff.create_gantt(df)
fig.show()

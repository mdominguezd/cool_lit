## Identification of knowledge gap

Some gaps that have been Identified:

- Understanding the impact of fire severity with GEDI metrics by themself it's not an easy task. (Going to the raw data)
    - Previous studies [@pascual_integrated_2023] have found that fire severity affects the energy metrics on the GEDI waveform data, but not significantly the AGBD metrics. (Although they used an patch-based approach)
    - Some patch-based approaches have been studied, but repeat GEDI measurements have not been studied deeply related to fires (Only [@holcomb_repeat_2024] did a bit).
- Geographic stratification of GEDI shots
- Biomass loss estimations using other EO datasets.
- Data fusion methods to improve the capability of using different EO data formats.

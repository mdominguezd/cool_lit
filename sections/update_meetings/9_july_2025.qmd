## Courses

### Start to Supervise BSc. & MSc. thesis

- LSD (Listen, Summarize, ask Deepening questions)

## Courses

### Project & time management

- Some tools for better time management (ClickUp)
- Nice group of people

## Courses

### PolInSAR

- Very technical.
- Some better unerstanding of Interferometric SAR and Polarimetric SAR, but not sure how much I will retain.

## Conferences/meetings

### NGC meeting

- Bigger picture of the project 
- Our contribution
- Good feedback from Maurizio and Simon. (Normalizing and control areas around BAs)

## Conferences/meetings

## Conferences/meetings

### Living Planet Symposium 

#### Xiao Liu from TU Dresden

Xiao working with GEDI time series by aggregating on 1km grid at Harz mountains in Germany.

- Could catch effect of seasonality on GEDI measurements as well (Winter vs. Summer).
- But also different trends in canopy ($\downarrow$) vs. understory ($\uparrow$).

## Conferences/meetings

### Living Planet Symposium 

#### Mariano Garcia and Alcal√° team

- Combustion completeness from multi-temporal ALS (Working a lot with PNOAD (Spain's AHN))
- Calculated C.C. as $\frac{|AGB_{post} - AGB_{pre}|}{AGB_{pre}}$
- Relation of C.C. with FRE (VIIRS)
- Caution with waveform changes and actual biomass change. 
- Open for visit

## Conferences/meetings

### Living Planet Symposium 

#### Misha and Simon (GFZ)

- Grasland GEDI optimization (Could be very interesting for other ecosystems)
- INPE ALS data for Amazon (Shared).
- RH50 not the best for checking changes on understory (influenced by overall canopy structure). Better metrics would be cover below a certain height (e.g. 5 or 10m).

## New insights

<!-- - LiDAR metrics extrapolated to Landsat for fires in Spain @viana-soto_assessing_2022. -->
- Paper from @clark_changes_2025 on GEDI-based metrics changes related to fires in California.
    - Used Amelia's 40m theshold.
    - Significant structural loss compared to control (buffer around BA).
    - Except for one metric that showed an increase after fire (RE_10m), increased penetration so more energy returned from lower layers.
    - Explored predictors of structural change, and found pre-fire fuel to be the main predictor.

## What's next

- Proposal feedback (Any time now according to Simon)
- Meeting w/ Amelia to discuss LPS poster.

### Iberia and Australia Feature Space matching

- A lot of the workflow done for Amazon can and will be reused. 
- Sampling for different undisturbed LC in Spain and Australian East Coast (Multi-temporal ALS).
- GEDI-data feature extraction and matching.
- ALS for pre-disturbance pair similarity validation.

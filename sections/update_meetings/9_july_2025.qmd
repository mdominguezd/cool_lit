## Courses

### Start to Supervise BSc. & MSc. thesis

- LSD (Listen, Summarize, ask Deepening questions)

### Project & time management

- Some tools for better time management (ClickUp)
- Nice group of people

### PolInSAR

- Very technical.
- Some better unerstanding of Interferometric SAR and Polarimetric SAR, but not sure how much I will retain.

## Conferences/meetings

### NGC meeting

- Bigger picture of the project 
- Our contribution

## Conferences/meetings

## Conferences/meetings

### Living Planet Symposium 

#### Xiao Liu from TU Dresden

Xiao working with GEDI time series by aggregating on 1km grid at Harz mountains in Germany.

- Could catch the same effect of seasonality
- But also different trends in over

## Conferences/meetings

### Living Planet Symposium 

#### Mariano Garcia and Alcal√° team

- Combustion completeness from multi-temporal ALS (Working a lot with PNOAD (Spain's AHN))
- Relation of C.C. with FRP (VIIRS)
- Caution with waveform changes and actual biomass change
- Open to visit

## Conferences/meetings

### Living Planet Symposium 

#### Misha and Simon

- Grasland GEDI optimization (Could be very interesting for other ecosystems)
- INPE ALS data for Amazon (Shared it with me).
- RH50 not the best for checking changes on understory, especially with GEDI.

## New insights

- LiDAR metrics extrapolated to Landsat for fires in Spain @viana-soto_assessing_2022.
- Paper from @clark_changes_2025.
    - 
- Dunia-LSCE Foundation model @fayad_dunia_2025

## What's next

### Iberia!

- Wait for proposal feedback.
- A lot of the workflow done for Amazon can and will be reused.
- Stratified sampling for different LCLU in Spain.
-

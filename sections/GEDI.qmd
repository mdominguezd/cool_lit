## [Repeat GEDI footprints measure the effects of tropical forest disturbances (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425724001925?via%3Dihub#f0005)

### Main ideas

-   (:rocket::satellite::link:) A method to examine forest changes using nearby GEDI footprints was developed.
-   (:evergreen_tree::fallen_leaf:) GEDI is able to capture biomass/canopy height losses after disturbances
    -   In 30x30m resolution
    -   At a population level
-   (:deciduous_tree: & :herb:) GEDI 3D view can also show different disturbance dynamics.
    -   e.g. Only under-story loss after fires
-   (:chart_with_upwards_trend:) GEDI biomass loss and Landsat AFC disturbance metrics are related.
    -   Opens possibility of ML models for extrapolating.
-   (:bulb:) GEDI can measure C emissions without new optical-detected disturbance.

### Intro

#### Important contextual info

-   Magnitude of carbon losses due to forest disturbance lacks scientific consensus.
    -   (29 - 73% of total carbon loss in tropical forests)
-   Forest disturbances are already well detected (GLAD + AFC), but carbon loss estimation associated is still challenging (esp. tropics)
-   Ideal tool: Annual biomass map created using frequent and consistent sensor (e.g. Optical and/or SAR).
    -   However, this doesn't exist. A problem: SAR tends to saturate with high biomass :/.
-   GEDI can't be used as the tool to monitor disturbances (No repeated cycles and affected by clouds).
    -   But, in some cases where disturbances have happened. It can be used to quantify the effect of those disturbances.

### Methods

1.  Pipeline for identifying spatially coincident GEDI shots with intervening forest changes detected by another wall-to-wall sensor.

2.  Created a *treatment* with intervening disturbances (13700), and a fair *control* group against which to test for statistical significance (65000 pairs) @fig-groups. Assuming homogeneity at d\<40m.

3.  Compared both groups to check if GEDI can measure biomass and canopy height loss at population level. (Used GLAD and AFC pairs)

    1.  (1:1 relationship on control)

    2.  S2 - S1 \< 0 in treatment.

4.  Studied relationships of disturbance extent, time since disturbance and disturbance intensity with biomass loss estimated by GEDI. (Used AFC pairs)

5.  Evaluated impacts of fires in the forest structure (e.g. Subcanopy loss). (GLAD pairs U MODIS burned area {614 pairs})

### Results

-   Control groups showed 1:1 relationship, but slightly noisier when considering areas were disturbances have happened.
-   Mean biomass loss was significantly higher in treatment than control for both AFC and GLAD. $\rightarrow$ Biomass loss can be estimated by GEDI. (Also for only degradation (Subset with AFC))
-   Linear relationship between biomass loss and disturbance extent, complex with time since disturbance and square relationship with disturbance intensity.
-   Forest structural changes detected after fires showed that 65% of samples didn't have canopy losses. and in 35% of this canopy preserved samples big part of under-story was lost.

#### Personal ideas

-   How important it is for Carbon models to differentiate if the biomass loss is due to deforestation or due to forest disturbance?
    -   Maybe not for Carbon models, but it is important for ecological reasons (Ecosystem services).
-   What is the viability of this being reproduce in Europe?
    -   GEDI coverage (Lats. \< 51.6º)
-   For checking structural changes checking the Waveform Structrutal Complexity Index product could also be feasible? Check [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52468-2).

### Main ideas

-   Forest structural complexity has a major influence on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity.

-   A 3D canopy complexity data product was derived from space-borne LiDAR (GEDI) measurements ([data](https://daac.ornl.gov/GEDI/guides/GEDI_L4C_WSCI.html)).

    -   Trained with ALS 3D complexity measurements (In-situ).

-   (🌎 Spatial variations) Highest complexity is present in tropical forests and this complexity is related to canopy attributes from lower and middle story.

### Introduction

-   **Forest structural complexity** is a function of the heterogeneity of canopy structure in tri-dimensional space.

    -   Determined by:

        -   🌳Tree diameter

        -   📏 Height

        -   🌲 Biomass

        -   🍃Leaf angle

        -   :wood: Deadwood

        -   Vertical layering

- GEDI waveforms record vertical distribution of leaves and branches from top of canopy to ground.

### Methods

- GEDI records vertical variations. Assuming that vertical and horizontal variations are related, authors tried to inferred 3D complexity out of GEDI records alone.
-   > 800,000 measured values of CE$_{xyz}$ were used to model the structural complexity.
- Extreme gradient boosted trees regression model was trained
$$ CE_{xyz} = XGBoost(GEDI_{L2}) $$
- Separate regression models were developed for each plant functional type (PFT): Evergreen Broadleef Trees (EBT), Deciduous Broadleef Tree (DBT), Evergreen Needleaf Trees (ENT) and Grasslands Shrublands, and Woodlands (GSW).
- Model uncertainty was quantified using conformal predictors (?).
- Spatial cross-validation was used to assess the performance.
- A PCA was performed to understand WSCI and

### Results

- The models resulted in a R$^{2}$ of 68% in the training data.
- Vertical complexity is better predicted (75%) than horizontal complexity (40%). Also it is mainly predicted by upper strata metrics.
    - Explained by: As canopy height increases, vertical layering also develops, increasing tree density.


## [On the NASA GEDI and ESA CCI biomass maps: aligning for uptake in the UNFCCC global stocktake](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad0b60)

A cmparison between GEDI agbd estimations and Climate Change Initiative Biomass estimations. Also, these were compared with National Forest Inventories (NFIs).

Main finding: Both products show strong correlation to NFI-estimated AGBD, with no systematic deviations. These results are remarkably promising, and to support the operational use of AGB map products for policy reporting

## [Repeat GEDI footprints measure the effects of tropical forest disturbances (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425724001925?via%3Dihub#f0005)

### Main ideas

-   (:rocket::satellite::link:) A method to examine forest changes using nearby GEDI footprints was developed.
-   (:evergreen_tree::fallen_leaf:) GEDI is able to capture biomass/canopy height losses after disturbances
    -   In 30x30m resolution
    -   At a population level
-   (:deciduous_tree: & :herb:) GEDI 3D view can also show different disturbance dynamics.
    -   e.g. Only under-story loss after fires
-   (:chart_with_upwards_trend:) GEDI biomass loss and Landsat AFC disturbance metrics are related.
    -   Opens possibility of ML models for extrapolating.
-   (:bulb:) GEDI can measure C emissions without new optical-detected disturbance.

### Intro

#### Important contextual info

-   Magnitude of carbon losses due to forest disturbance lacks scientific consensus.
    -   (29 - 73% of total carbon loss in tropical forests)
-   Forest disturbances are already well detected (GLAD + AFC), but carbon loss estimation associated is still challenging (esp. tropics)
-   Ideal tool: Annual biomass map created using frequent and consistent sensor (e.g. Optical and/or SAR).
    -   However, this doesn't exist. A problem: SAR tends to saturate with high biomass :/.
-   GEDI can't be used as the tool to monitor disturbances (No repeated cycles and affected by clouds).
    -   But, in some cases where disturbances have happened. It can be used to quantify the effect of those disturbances.

### Methods

1.  Pipeline for identifying spatially coincident GEDI shots with intervening forest changes detected by another wall-to-wall sensor.

2.  Created a *treatment* with intervening disturbances (13700), and a fair *control* group against which to test for statistical significance (65000 pairs) @fig-groups. Assuming homogeneity at d\<40m.

3.  Compared both groups to check if GEDI can measure biomass and canopy height loss at population level. (Used GLAD and AFC pairs)

    1.  (1:1 relationship on control)

    2.  S2 - S1 \< 0 in treatment.

4.  Studied relationships of disturbance extent, time since disturbance and disturbance intensity with biomass loss estimated by GEDI. (Used AFC pairs)

5.  Evaluated impacts of fires in the forest structure (e.g. Subcanopy loss). (GLAD pairs U MODIS burned area {614 pairs})

### Results

-   Control groups showed 1:1 relationship, but slightly noisier when considering areas were disturbances have happened.
-   Mean biomass loss was significantly higher in treatment than control for both AFC and GLAD. $\rightarrow$ Biomass loss can be estimated by GEDI. (Also for only degradation (Subset with AFC))
-   Linear relationship between biomass loss and disturbance extent, complex with time since disturbance and square relationship with disturbance intensity.
-   Forest structural changes detected after fires showed that 65% of samples didn't have canopy losses. and in 35% of this canopy preserved samples big part of under-story was lost.

#### Personal ideas

-   How important it is for Carbon models to differentiate if the biomass loss is due to deforestation or due to forest disturbance?
    -   Maybe not for Carbon models, but it is important for ecological reasons (Ecosystem services).
-   What is the viability of this being reproduce in Europe?
    -   GEDI coverage (Lats. \< 51.6º)
-   For checking structural changes checking the Waveform Structrutal Complexity Index product could also be feasible? Check [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52468-2).

## [Characterizing the structural complexity of the Earth’s forests with spaceborne lidar](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52468-2)

### Main ideas

-   Forest structural complexity has a major influence on ecosystem functioning and biodiversity.

-   A 3D canopy complexity data product was derived from space-borne LiDAR (GEDI) measurements ([data](https://daac.ornl.gov/GEDI/guides/GEDI_L4C_WSCI.html)).

    -   Trained with ALS 3D complexity measurements (In-situ).

-   (🌎 Spatial variations) Highest complexity is present in tropical forests and this complexity is related to canopy attributes from lower and middle story.

### Introduction

-   **Forest structural complexity** is a function of the heterogeneity of canopy structure in tri-dimensional space.

    -   Determined by:

        -   🌳Tree diameter

        -   📏 Height

        -   🌲 Biomass

        -   🍃Leaf angle

        -   :wood: Deadwood

        -   Vertical layering

- GEDI waveforms record vertical distribution of leaves and branches from top of canopy to ground.

### Methods

- GEDI records vertical variations. Assuming that vertical and horizontal variations are related, authors tried to inferred 3D complexity out of GEDI records alone.
-   > 800,000 measured values of CE$_{xyz}$ were used to model the structural complexity.
- Extreme gradient boosted trees regression model was trained
$$ CE_{xyz} = XGBoost(GEDI_{L2}) $$
- Separate regression models were developed for each plant functional type (PFT): Evergreen Broadleef Trees (EBT), Deciduous Broadleef Tree (DBT), Evergreen Needleaf Trees (ENT) and Grasslands Shrublands, and Woodlands (GSW).
- Model uncertainty was quantified using conformal predictors (?).
- Spatial cross-validation was used to assess the performance.
- A PCA was performed to understand relationship between WSCI and other structural variables (e.g. PAI, tree cover)
- A PCR (regression) was performed including and excluding the WSCI to check if it gives additional information not given by other GEDI metrics.
- Linear regression beteen WSCI and modeled and canopy height to check power law scaling relationships.

### Results

- The models resulted in a R$^{2}$ of 68% in the training data.
- Highest errors in regions of sparse tree cover (e.g. Grasslands, shrublands, woodlands). **GEDI is not optimized to measure vert. structure of short plants (e.g. 2-3m)**
    - Heterosceasticity (Variance of errors increase as complexity decreases).
- Vertical complexity is better predicted (75%) than horizontal complexity (40%). Also it is mainly predicted by upper strata metrics.
    - Explained by: As canopy height increases, vertical layering also develops, increasing tree density.

#### Global patterns
- Latitudinal pattern: Higher WSCI in tropics (:seedling: :herb: 🌳), decrease on higher latitudes (🌲).
- Complexity in tropical forests depends more on lower and middle layers, while on temperate forests more strongly on upper layers.

#### Complexity $\propto$ other structural elements
- PCA shows that forest density (**PC1,** (PAI, Tree cover)) captures broad-scale differences between regions and, vertical stratification and canopy height (**PC2,** (FHD, RH98, WSCI)) captures variations within these regions.
- PCRs show that WSCI capures 11% of variation no included on other GEDI metrics.

#### Complexity and height
- Relationship between WSCI and canopy height can be described by a power law with scaling exponents that differ depending on region (Tropical, Temperate, Others).
- Tall forests are more complex, but in tropical forests short forests are also complex. This makes them special.

### Discussion points
- Even though RH metrics are correlated among themselves, the division into three strata weakens that correlation. Thus, making them useful for modeling.
- Structural complexity is 3D (So also horizontal), the modelling of WSCI relies on inference of horizontal complexity from rel. with vertical complexity.
- Power-law scaling varies greatly depending on biomes. This is associated to differences in tree species, competition and other ecological dynamics.
- WSCI could be useful to assess forest degradation (e.g. comparing it with potential structural complexity). However, take with grain of salt cause methods to calculate potential and actual complexity differ.
- Fusion models are needed to improve spatial scale and this could also help improve models on areas with sparse tree cover.
- WSCI serves as an integrator of various structural metrics, but still much remains to understand abour structural complexity (i.e. How it develops, how it may be managed, what implies on ecosystem functioning)


## [On the NASA GEDI and ESA CCI biomass maps: aligning for uptake in the UNFCCC global stocktake](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad0b60)

A comparison between GEDI agbd estimations and Climate Change Initiative Biomass estimations. Also, these were compared with National Forest Inventories (NFIs).

**Main finding:** Both products show strong correlation to NFI-estimated AGBD, with no systematic deviations. These results are remarkably promising, and to support the operational use of AGB map products for policy reporting, but the methodologies to report uncerainty are not always transparent.

### Main ideas

- Earth Observation data can effectively estimate forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD) in line with UNFCCC principles, but their use for national-level reporting is minimal as of 2023, coinciding with the end of the first Global Stocktake (GST).
- A comparison of AGBD estimates from NASA's GEDI and ESA's CCI reveals significant differences, particularly in the Congolese lowlands and east/southeast Asia, while showing strong correlation with National Forest Inventories (NFIs) in regions like Peru and Mexico
- The study emphasizes the need for alignment between scientific teams to enhance the operational use of AGBD maps for policy reporting, recommending consistent statistical terminology and a rigorous framework for uncertainty estimation.
- The authors advocate for user-friendly documentation and tools that facilitate the integration of NFIs with AGBD products, aiming to improve the accuracy of national biomass estimates and ensure that space agencies provide reliable global biomass data for policy impact.

### Seeking alignment

"Large differences exist not only between the map AGBD estimates, but also in the analytical frameworks used to estimate uncertainties, their underlying scope, definitions, assumptions and level of transparency."

Then scientific community should:

- Align uncertainty assessment frameworks <font color='blue'>(**GEDI > CCI** The GEDI products clearly show how to measure the accuracy of AGBD predictions, making it easier to follow IPCC guidelines for large areas.)</font>
- Provide source codes for large area estimations.
- Provide guidance on enhancing NFIs with AGBD maps
- Make documentation and usability practical for UNFCCC reporting

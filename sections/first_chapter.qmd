# Space-borne LiDAR comparable pairs for small-scale analyses

## Main ideas

-   There is a lot of difficulties for small-scale analysis using GEDI data for before and after comparisons [@east_measuring_2023; @mandl_spaceborne_2023].
-   **Hypothesis:** Difficulties appear due to differences on specific covariates between shots. (e.g. Topography, Land Cover, Tree species)
-   **Solution proposed:** A systematic way to get comparable GEDI metrics should be developed.

## Literature review

### Questions that I want to answer:

-   What methods have been used to obtain comparable space-borne LiDAR measurements ***over small area***?
-   What are the main challenges and best practices in comparing measurements from GEDI, ICESat-2, or other space-borne LiDAR datasets and how do researchers deal with them?
    -   Vertical accuracy, geo-location error
    -   Temporal resolution (Time between shots and disturbances)
    -   How is vertical accuracy affected by land cover and topography.
-   What pre-processing techniques (e.g. filtering, interpolation) are used?
    -   Describe Amelia's, Milenkovic's and Pronk's thorough filtering process.
    -   Describe Ji's waveform pre-processing and slope correction and the potential of extrapolating that to two near-coincident shots (?)

#### Methods used to obtain comparable GEDI measurements

@holcomb_repeat_2024 developed a method to examine forest changes using nearby GEDI footprints. These nearby GEDI footprints were chosen using a 40 meter threshold. They showed that GEDI is able to capture biomass/canopy height losses after disturbances in a 30x30m resolution and at a population level.

#### Main challenges

-   GEDI footprints have a geo-location error of approximately 10.2 m.
-   Factors that can lead to systematic biases in canopy height estimations, complicating comparisons:
    -   Vegetation type
    -   Canopy height
    -   Terrain slope 


```{python}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: asis # Important for voila

import numpy as np
import ipywidgets as widgets
from IPython.display import display

num_input = widgets.IntText(description="Slope angle [Â°] : ")
result = widgets.Label(value="Result: ")

def slope_elev_change(n):
    degs = n * (np.pi / 180)
    diam = 25  # m
    result.value = f"Result: {0.5 * diam * np.tan(degs)} meters"

num_input.observe(lambda change: slope_elev_change(change['new']), names='value')

display(num_input, result)
```

#### Pre-processing techniques for space-borne LiDAR pair handling

Methods to improve the comparability of space-borne LiDAR pairs have been developed recently (Specifically, these methods could improve the vertical accuracy of GEDI). @ji_deforestation_2024 used overlapping pairs of GEDI and ICE-Sat to improve the calculation of ground elevation and thus ameliorate the canopy height calculations. These overlapping pairs were then used to assess their capability to detect deforestation in Brazil.

Other researchers have mainly focused on filtering GEDI data, based on quality assessments and/or variables that could influence it.

# Spaceborne LiDAR comparable pairs for small-scale analyses

## Main ideas

- There is a lot of difficulties for small-scale analysis using GEDI data for before and after comparisons [@east_measuring_2023;@mandl_spaceborne_2023].
- **Hypothesis:** Difficulties appear due to differences on specific covariates between shots. (e.g. Topography, Land Cover, Tree species)
- A systematic way to get comparable GEDI metrics should be developed.

## Literature review 

### Questions that I want to answer:
- What methods have been used to obtain comparable spaceborne LiDAR measurements over small areas?
- What are the main challenges and best practices in comparing GEDI, ICESat-2, or other spaceborne LiDAR datasets and how do researchers deal with them?
- What pre-processing techniques (e.g. filtering, interpolation) are used?

#### Methods used to obtain comparable GEDI measurements

@holcomb_repeat_2024 developed a method to examine forest changes using nearby GEDI footprints. These nearby GEDI footprints were chosen using a 40 meter threshold. They showed that GEDI is able to capture biomass/canopy height losses after disturbances in a 30x30m resolution and at a population level.

#### Main challenges

- GEDI footprints have a geolocation error of approximately 10.2 m. 
- Environmental Influences: Factors such as vegetation type, canopy height, and terrain slope can lead to systematic biases in canopy height estimations, complicating comparisons


#### Pre-processing techniques for spaceborne LiDAR pair handling

Methods to improve the comparability of spaceborne LiDAR pairs have been developed recently.@ji_deforestation_2024 used overlapping pairs of GEDI and ICE-Sat to improve the calculation of ground elevation and thus ameliorate the canopy height calculations. These overlapping pairs were then used to assess their capability to detect deforestation in Brazil.

Other researchers have mainly focused on filtering GEDI data, based on quality assessments and/or variables that could influence it.


#### Validation 

- PNOA LiDAR project in Spain.

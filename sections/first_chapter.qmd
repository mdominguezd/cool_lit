# Space-borne LiDAR comparable pairs for small-scale analyses

## Main ideas

-   There is a lot of challenges for small-scale analysis using GEDI data for before and after disturbance comparisons [@east_measuring_2023; @mandl_spaceborne_2023].

:::{layout-ncol="2"}

**Hypothesis:** Difficulties appear due to differences on specific covariates between shots. (e.g. Topography, Land Cover, Tree species)

**Solution proposed:** A systematic way to get comparable GEDI metrics should be developed.

:::

## Literature review

### Questions that I want to answer:

-   What methods have been used to obtain comparable space-borne LiDAR measurements ***over small areas*** (How small is small)?
-   What are the main challenges and best practices in comparing measurements from GEDI, ICESat-2, or other space-borne LiDAR datasets and how do researchers deal with them?
    -   Vertical accuracy, geo-location error
    -   Temporal resolution (Time between shots and disturbances)
    -   How is vertical accuracy affected by land cover and topography.
-   What pre-processing techniques (e.g. filtering, interpolation) are used?
    -   Describe Amelia's, Milenkovic's and Pronk's thorough filtering process.
    -   Describe Ji's waveform pre-processing and slope correction and the potential of extrapolating that to two near-coincident shots (?)

#### Methods used to obtain comparable GEDI measurements

@holcomb_repeat_2024 developed a method to examine forest changes using nearby GEDI footprints. These nearby GEDI footprints were chosen using a 40 meter threshold. They showed that GEDI is able to capture biomass/canopy height losses after disturbances in a 30x30m resolution and at a population level.

Different approaches not using spatially coincident pairs have also 

#### Main challenges

Factors that can lead to systematic biases in canopy height estimations, complicating comparisons:

##### Geo-location errors

GEDI footprints have a geo-location error of approximately 10.2 m. Low geolocation accuracy can cause errors on the calculation of ground elevation. Moreover, on heterogenous canopiews, geolocation error can cause the measurement to be taken over a different part of the canopy than the one presented.

Big improvements related to geolocation error have taken place passing from GEDI v1 to v2 [@pronk_assessing_2024]. Additionally, researchers have also 

##### Terrain slope 

The terrain slope significantly affects spaceborne LiDAR measurements. On sloped terrain, laser pulses reflect from both vegetation and the ground simultaneously, leading to overlapping signals and complicating the separation of canopy and ground returns [@ji_deforestation_2024]. The maximum error associated to sloped terrains can be modeled as $max(\epsilon) = \frac{1}{2}*D*tan(slope)$ and is presented on @fig-slope

```{python}
#| echo: false
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('ggplot')
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-slope
#| fig-cap: Error on verticl accuracy
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

num_input = np.arange(0,70,5)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize = (6,3))
ax.plot(num_input, 0.5 * 25 * np.tan(num_input * (np.pi / 180)))

ax.set_ylabel('max(error) vertical accuracy')
a = ax.set_xlabel('Slope')
```

##### Temporal resolution

When actual pairs are found, another big challenge is to evaluate if these pairs can be comparable based on what has happened during the time between shots. @east_measuring_2023 found for instance that structural changes vary as a function of time after disturbance (Initially seen on lower layers, then on upper canopy).

##### Land cover

In forests with dense, multi-layered canopies, the GEDI laser pulse might be intercepted by upper canopy elements, preventing it from reaching the ground. This can lead to an overestimation of canopy height or an inaccurate ground elevation reading, affecting the overall height calculation.

#### Preprocessing techniques for spaceborne LiDAR pair handling

##### Filtering techniques

Describe here filters used by @holcomb_repeat_2024 @milenkovic_assessing_2022.

##### Ground and canopy height correction

Methods to improve the comparability of space-borne LiDAR pairs have been developed recently (Specifically, these methods could improve the vertical accuracy of GEDI). @ji_deforestation_2024 used overlapping pairs of GEDI and ICE-Sat to improve the calculation of ground elevation and thus ameliorate the canopy height calculations. These overlapping pairs were then used to assess their capability to detect deforestation in Brazil.

Other researchers have mainly focused on filtering GEDI data, based on quality assessments and/or variables that could influence it [@holcomb_repeat_2024, @pronk_assessing_2024]

##### Geographic stratification of GEDI data

@chen_improved_2023 performed a geographic stratification based on topographic and vegetation features to map AGB. Their results showed that using a stratified sample technique improved the accuracy of AGB estimates by up to 34.8%.

# Integration of space-borne LiDAR data pairs and multi frequency earth observation data for upscaling vegetation structural changes in burned areas. A European case study.

## Main ideas

-  If wall-to-wall products can explain the spatial variation of vegetation structural changes; a model, in which LiDAR pairs are used as training data and other EO products as covariates, could be used to upscale the structural changes for a whole burned area.
-  This methodology should be validated with more refined datasets (e.g. Airborne or Terrestrial Laser Scanning)

## Literature review

- What are the current methods for integrating LiDAR and other EO data to assess vegetation structure? (Normally not structure change)
- How have previous studies quantify vegetation structural changes in fire-affected areas, and what are the main limitations?
- What machine learning or statistical models have been applied for upscaling vegetation structural metrics from LiDAR data to broader spatial scales using optical and radar data?

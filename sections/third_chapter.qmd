# Global assessment of fire-induced vegetation structural changes  

## Main ideas

-  If wall-to-wall products can explain the spatial variation of vegetation structural changes; a model, in which LiDAR pairs are used as training data and other EO products as covariates, could be used to upscale the structural changes for a whole burned area.
-  This methodology should be validated with more refined 

## Literature review

- What are the current methods for integrating LiDAR and other EO data to assess vegetation structure? (Normally not structure change)
- How have previous studies used space-borne LiDAR data to quantify vegetation structural changes in fire-affected areas, and what are the main limitations?

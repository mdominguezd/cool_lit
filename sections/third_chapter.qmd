# Evaluate the scalability of integrating GEDI and Earth observation data for detecting fire-induced vegetation changes and improving fire emission estimates 

## Main ideas

-  How can the method developed for a specific case study be extrapolated to different domains?

## Literature review

- Location embeddings (SatCLIP)

#### Foundation models (GFZ)

Self-supervised learning + scale make them capable of generalize so well for multiple tasks.

# Evaluate the scalability of integrating GEDI and Earth observation data for detecting fire-induced vegetation changes and improving fire emission estimates 

## Main idea

-  Fire emission models can underestimate emissions due to exclusion of small fires and fixed (biome-specific) combustion completeness factors.

:::{layout-ncol="2"}

**Hypothesis:** If a model integrating GEDI and EO data can perform well for a specific domain (region of interest), geographical generalization methods could be used to implement that model in different regions. And this model could be used to improve combustion completeness estimation for fire emission models. 

**Proposed outcome:** A global model for vegetation structure change evaluation caused by fires.

## Literature review

## Questions I want to answer

- How do fire regimes vary across different biomes globally?
- What are the primary drivers of fire-induced vegetation change in tropical, temperate, boreal, and arid ecosystems?
- How do different satellite data perform in assessing burn severity across ecosystems?
- What are the current methods to improve geographic generalization on Machine Learning models?
- How can you quantify and propagate uncertainty in global vegetation change models?
- What are the best in situ or plot-level datasets for validating remote sensing observations globally?

#### ***How do fire regimes vary across different biomes globally?***

Fuel moisture and continuity are critical in determining fire regimes. In tropical and boreal ecosystems, moisture levels significantly influence fire occurrence and intensity, with drier conditions promoting more extensive fires [@kelley_how_2019].

#### ***Geographic generalization on Machine Learning models***


##### Foundation models (GFZ)

Self-supervised learning + scale make them capable of generalize so well for multiple tasks.

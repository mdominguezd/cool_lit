# Forest & Climate change

## [Forest disturbances under climate change (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3303)

### Main ideas

- Warmer and drier conditions particularly facilitate fire, drought and insect disturbances
- Warmer and wetter conditions increase disturbances from wind and pathogens.
- Interactions between different disturbance agents may amplify their effects, while vegetation changes could reduce the long-term sensitivities to climate.
- Most pronounced changes in disturbances are expected in coniferous forests and the boreal biome

### Forest fires (:fire:) on CC scenario

- Climate change is likely to increase the frequency and intensity of forest fires due to warmer and drier conditions
- **Fire disturbances are one of the primary agents expected to dominate future forest disturbance regimes globally** (With insects and pathogens)

# Remote sensing for forest fires

## [Development of an emission estimation method with satellite observations for significant forest fires and comparison with global fire emission inventories: Application to catastrophic fires of summer 2021 over the Eastern Mediterranean](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231023002972)

### GFED underestimations

- GFED showed lower estimates compared to other FE datasets and to the one developed in the study.
- The discrepancies were attributed to GFED's **low spatial resolution** (Indy) and inconsistencies in input parameters **biomass burning emissions** (Me).

## [On the NASA GEDI and ESA CCI biomass maps: Aligning for uptake in the UNFCCC global stocktake](https://www.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad0b60)

### Main ideas

- Earth Observation data can effectively estimate forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD) in line with UNFCCC principles, but their use for national-level reporting is minimal as of 2023, coinciding with the end of the first Global Stocktake (GST).
- A comparison of AGBD estimates from NASA's GEDI and ESA's CCI reveals significant differences, particularly in the Congolese lowlands and east/southeast Asia, while showing strong correlation with National Forest Inventories (NFIs) in regions like Peru and Mexico
- The study emphasizes the need for alignment between scientific teams to enhance the operational use of AGBD maps for policy reporting, recommending consistent statistical terminology and a rigorous framework for uncertainty estimation.
- The authors advocate for user-friendly documentation and tools that facilitate the integration of NFIs with AGBD products, aiming to improve the accuracy of national biomass estimates and ensure that space agencies provide reliable global biomass data for policy impact.

### Uncertainty estimation standardization

"Large differences exist not only between the map AGBD estimates, but also in the analytical frameworks used to estimate uncertainties, their underlying scope, definitions, assumptions and level of transparency."

Then scientific community should:
- Align uncertainty assessment frameworks <font color='blue'>(**GEDI > CCI** The GEDI products clearly show how to measure the accuracy of AGBD predictions, making it easier to follow IPCC guidelines for large areas.)</font>
- Provide source codes for large area estimations.

## [Remote sensing for wildfire monitoring: Insights into burned area, emissions, and fire dynamics (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590332224002574)

### Main takeaways for me
- Divided the paper into RS for BA, FE and AF.
- Thermal imagers, which detect the infrared radiation emitted by fires, are the primary tools for real-time monitoring of AFs. Burning vegetation at temperatures between 500°C and 1,200°C emits significantly more infrared radiation than its surroundings.
- The Global Fire Emissions Database BA (GFED BA) combines information from multiple satellite platforms to obtain better BA datasets, using the MODIS MCD64 BA product as its primary input. AF data from the ATSR and VIRS sensors are used to extend the data record prior to the MODIS era. 

#### Methods for using remotely sensed data to estimate fire emissions.
1. The formula for estimating gas and aerosol species emitted from fires (E) follows several sequential steps: **Ei = A × B × C × EFi**, where A is the area burned; *B is the biomass available per area*; C is combustion completeness, representing the fraction of biomass actually consumed; and EFi is the emission factor for species i. (This approach has produced most of the current fire emissions datasets, including GFED, FLAMBE, GICC, WFEIS, MFLEI, and FINN) **(Bottom-up approach)**
2. Physically based on the linear correlation between remotely sensed fire radiative energy and biomass consumed in fires, independent of vegetation type. **(Top-down approach)**
3. Satellite instruments measure atmospheric concentrations of fire-emitted pollutants (CO, NOx, CO2) and integrate these with **atmospheric inversion**.

#### Limitations
- AF detections often suffer from false alarms due to bright surfaces reflecting sunlight that cannot be completely screened out using available image bands. 
- BA algorithms can misinterpret land-use changes as fire activity
- Small, cool, understory, and sub-surface fires are frequently omitted.
- **BIG DOMAIN ADAPTATION POTENTIAL:** Data integration poses additional challenges. Developing algorithms that perform well globally is difficult due to regional differences in vegetation, fire behavior, and climate.

## [Assessing the performance of MODIS and VIIRS active fire products in the monitoring of wildfires: a case study in Turkey (2022)](https://iforest.sisef.org/contents/?id=ifor3754-015)

### Main ideas

- These products have some limitations in detecting fires in forested areas due to closed canopy and smoke.
- Results indicated that the overall accuracy of MODIS ranged from **0.6% to 16.6%** and VIIRS ranged from **1.3% to 25.6%** of all ground-based fires.
- Detection rates increased as the fire size increased.
